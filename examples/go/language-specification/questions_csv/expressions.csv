What is the result type of an expression involving binary operators?<br><br>A. The type of the first operand<br>B. The type of the second operand<br>C. The type that matches the operation's rules<br>D. Always an integer type,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>The result type of an expression involving binary operators is determined by the types of the operands and the specific rules governing the operation, which may involve type conversions or specific type requirements."
"In the context of operators, what does the term 'untyped constant' refer to?<br><br>A. A constant that has no associated type<br>B. A constant that can be converted to any type<br>C. A constant that is only used in expressions<br>D. A constant that is defined at runtime","<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>An untyped constant is a constant that does not have an explicitly defined type and can be used in various contexts where a specific type is required, allowing for flexibility in expressions."
What happens if the right operand in a shift expression is not of integer type?<br><br>A. The expression is evaluated as a float<br>B. A run-time panic occurs<br>C. The expression is evaluated as zero<br>D. The expression is ignored,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>If the right operand in a shift expression is not of integer type, a run-time panic occurs, as the shift operation requires the right operand to be a valid integer type."
What is the purpose of a conversion in programming?<br><br>A. To change the type of an expression to a specified type<br>B. To combine multiple expressions into one<br>C. To evaluate an expression at runtime<br>D. To create a new variable in the program,<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>A conversion is used to change the type of an expression to the type specified by the conversion. This allows for compatibility between different types in operations and function calls.
"Which of the following is a valid form of explicit conversion?<br><br>A. T(x)<br>B. x.T()<br>C. convert(x, T)<br>D. T -> x","<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The valid form of explicit conversion is T(x), where T is the target type and x is the expression being converted. This syntax clearly indicates the type conversion being performed."
What happens when converting a constant value to a type that is not a type parameter?<br><br>A. It yields a typed constant.<br>B. It results in a runtime error.<br>C. It produces an untyped constant.<br>D. It has no effect on the value.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>When converting a constant to a type that is not a type parameter, it yields a typed constant. This means the constant is now associated with a specific type, which can be used in type-specific operations."
"Which of the following statements about conversions is true?<br><br>A. Conversions can only be applied to numeric types.<br>B. A non-constant value can be converted to a type if it is assignable to that type.<br>C. Conversions are only allowed for variables, not for literals.<br>D. All conversions result in a runtime evaluation.","<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A non-constant value can be converted to a type if it is assignable to that type. This means that as long as the value can be assigned to the target type without any issues, the conversion is valid."
What is the result of converting an integer to a floating-point type?<br><br>A. The integer is rounded to the nearest whole number.<br>B. The integer is truncated towards zero.<br>C. The integer is represented exactly as a floating-point number.<br>D. The conversion is illegal.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>When converting an integer to a floating-point type, the integer is represented exactly as a floating-point number. This allows for precise representation of the integer value in floating-point format."
What is a constant expression?<br><br>A. An expression that can only contain constant operands and is evaluated at compile time.<br>B. An expression that can include variables and is evaluated at runtime.<br>C. An expression that yields a constant value regardless of the operands used.<br>D. An expression that can only be used in function calls.,<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>A constant expression is defined as an expression that contains only constant operands and is evaluated at compile time. This means that the values involved in the expression do not change and are known before the program runs.
What happens when an untyped constant is used in a constant expression?<br><br>A. It is treated as a typed constant.<br>B. It is evaluated to a constant of the same type as the first operand.<br>C. It is ignored in the evaluation.<br>D. It causes a runtime error.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>When an untyped constant is used in a constant expression, it is evaluated to a constant of the same type as the first operand. This allows for flexibility in using constants without needing to specify their types explicitly."
Which of the following is true about the evaluation of constant expressions?<br><br>A. They can yield different results based on runtime conditions.<br>B. They are always evaluated exactly at compile time.<br>C. They can include variables that change during execution.<br>D. They can only be used in specific contexts like function calls.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Constant expressions are always evaluated exactly at compile time. This means that their values are determined during the compilation process, ensuring that they do not change during the execution of the program."
What is the result of a constant division operation if the divisor is zero?<br><br>A. The result is zero.<br>B. The operation is illegal and causes a compile-time error.<br>C. The operation is illegal and causes a runtime panic.<br>D. The result is an untyped constant.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>In constant expressions, if the divisor of a division operation is zero, it is illegal and will cause a runtime panic. This is to prevent undefined behavior in the program."
"What type of constants can be used in constant expressions?<br><br>A. Only integer constants.<br>B. Only untyped constants.<br>C. Any combination of untyped boolean, numeric, and string constants.<br>D. Only string constants.","<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>Constant expressions can include any combination of untyped boolean, numeric, and string constants. This allows for a wide range of operations and evaluations within constant expressions."
What determines the order of evaluation for operands in an expression?<br><br>A. The order in which they are written in the code<br>B. The type of the operands involved<br>C. Lexical left-to-right order<br>D. The precedence of the operators used,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>The order of evaluation for operands in an expression is determined by lexical left-to-right order. This means that function calls, method calls, receive operations, and binary logical operations are evaluated in the order they appear from left to right, regardless of the operator precedence."
"In the expression 'y[f()], ok = g(z || h(), i()+x[j()], <-c), k()', which function is guaranteed to be evaluated first?<br><br>A. f()<br>B. g()<br>C. k()<br>D. h()","<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>In the expression 'y[f()], ok = g(z || h(), i()+x[j()], <-c), k()', the function f() is guaranteed to be evaluated first because it is the first operand in the assignment. The evaluation order of function calls is determined by their position in the expression, and f() appears before g() and k()."
How does the order of evaluation differ at the package level compared to function-local expressions?<br><br>A. There is no difference; both are evaluated left to right.<br>B. Package-level evaluations are determined by initialization dependencies.<br>C. Function-local expressions are evaluated based on operator precedence.<br>D. Package-level evaluations ignore all dependencies.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>At the package level, initialization dependencies determine the evaluation order of individual initialization expressions. This means that the order of evaluation can be influenced by the dependencies between variables, overriding the left-to-right evaluation rule that applies to function-local expressions."
What happens if the evaluation order between two function calls is not specified?<br><br>A. The program will throw a compile-time error.<br>B. The results of the function calls will always be the same.<br>C. The results may vary depending on the implementation.<br>D. The first function will always be evaluated before the second.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>If the evaluation order between two function calls is not specified, the results may vary depending on the implementation. This means that the outcome of the program could differ based on how the compiler or runtime environment decides to evaluate the expressions."
