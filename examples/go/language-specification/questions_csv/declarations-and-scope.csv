Type parameter declaration,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>A variable declaration is distinct from a type declaration. While type declarations bind identifiers to types (either as aliases or new types), variable declarations create variables and bind identifiers to them with specific types and initial values."
"In a type declaration, what is an alias declaration?<br><br>A. It creates a new type that is distinct from the original.<br>B. It binds an identifier to an existing type.<br>C. It defines a function with a specific return type.<br>D. It specifies a type parameter for a generic type.","<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>An alias declaration binds an identifier to an existing type, allowing the identifier to be used interchangeably with that type. This does not create a new type but provides a more convenient name for an existing one."
"What distinguishes a type definition from an alias declaration?<br><br>A. A type definition creates a new, distinct type.<br>B. An alias declaration cannot be used in function signatures.<br>C. A type definition cannot have methods associated with it.<br>D. An alias declaration requires type parameters.","<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>A type definition creates a new, distinct type that is different from any other type, including the type it is based on.

Type constraints can only be applied to numeric types.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Type constraints must be interfaces that define the set of permissible type arguments for the respective type parameter. They control the operations supported by values of that type parameter, but they cannot be used as the types of values or variables."
How does a type argument satisfy a type constraint?<br><br>A. By being declared in the same package as the type constraint.<br>B. By implementing the interface defined by the type constraint.<br>C. By being a primitive type such as int or float.<br>D. By being declared as a constant in the same scope.,<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A type argument satisfies a type constraint if it implements the interface defined by that constraint. This means that the type argument must provide the methods and properties required by the interface to be considered valid.
What happens if a type parameter list declares a type parameter with a constraint that refers to itself?<br><br>A. It is allowed and will compile without issues.<br>B. It results in a parsing ambiguity and is illegal.<br>C. It creates a recursive type that can be used in declarations.<br>D.
