Using 'break' to terminate a labeled loop.<br>D. Using 'break' to declare a variable.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>Using 'break' to terminate a labeled loop is a correct use of the statement. It allows the programmer to exit from a specific loop or switch statement that has been labeled, providing greater control over program flow."
What is the primary function of a 'continue' statement in a loop?<br><br>A. To terminate the loop immediately<br>B. To skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration<br>C. To exit the loop and return a value<br>D. To pause the loop until a condition is met,<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The 'continue' statement is used to skip the current iteration of the innermost enclosing 'for' loop and proceed to the next iteration. This allows the loop to continue executing without completing the remaining statements in the current iteration.
"In which context can a 'continue' statement be used?<br><br>A. Within any function, regardless of the type of loop<br>B. Only within a 'for' loop<br>C. In both 'for' and 'switch' statements<br>D. Only in 'select' statements","<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A 'continue' statement can only be used within a 'for' loop. It is specifically designed to advance control to the end of the loop block, allowing the next iteration to begin immediately."
What happens if a 'continue' statement is labeled?<br><br>A. It will skip to the next iteration of the outermost loop<br>B. It will skip to the next iteration of the labeled loop<br>C. It will terminate the labeled loop<br>D. It will cause a compilation error,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>If a 'continue' statement is labeled, it will skip to the next iteration of the loop that is associated with the label. This allows for more control over which loop's iteration is affected when there are nested loops."
Which of the following statements is true about the 'continue' statement?<br><br>A. It can be used to skip the execution of a 'switch' statement.<br>B. It can only be used in loops that have a condition.<br>C. It must be the last statement in a loop block.<br>D. It does not affect the execution of the loop's post statements.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> D<br><br>The 'continue' statement does not affect the execution of the loop's post statements. When a 'continue' statement is executed, control jumps to the end of the loop, and the post statement (if present) will still be executed before the next iteration begins."
What is the primary function of a 'goto' statement in programming?<br><br>A. To transfer control to a labeled statement within the same function<br>B. To create a loop that repeats a block of code<br>C. To define a new function or method<br>D. To terminate the execution of a program,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The primary function of a 'goto' statement is to transfer control to a labeled statement within the same function. This allows for non-linear control flow, enabling the program to jump to different parts of the code based on certain conditions."
Which of the following is a restriction when using a 'goto' statement?<br><br>A. It can only jump to labels within the same function.<br>B. It must always be used with a loop.<br>C. It can only be used at the beginning of a function.<br>D. It cannot be used in conjunction with other control statements.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>A restriction when using a 'goto' statement is that it can only jump to labels within the same function. This means that the label must be defined in the same scope as the 'goto' statement, ensuring that the control flow remains within the same function context."
What happens if a 'goto' statement attempts to jump to a label that is not in scope?<br><br>A. The program will execute normally without any issues.<br>B. The program will terminate with an error.<br>C. The program will skip the 'goto' statement.<br>D. The program will enter an infinite loop.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>If a 'goto' statement attempts to jump to a label that is not in scope, the program will terminate with an error. This is because the jump would skip the creation of any variables that are defined in the scope of the label, leading to undefined behavior."
In which scenario is a 'goto' statement considered erroneous?<br><br>A. When it jumps to a label defined within the same function.<br>B. When it jumps to a label defined inside a block that is not in scope.<br>C. When it is used to exit a loop.<br>D. When it is used to call a function.,<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A 'goto' statement is considered erroneous when it jumps to a label defined inside a block that is not in scope. This violates the rules of variable scope and can lead to errors in the program's execution.
What is the primary function of a fallthrough statement in a switch statement?<br><br>A. To transfer control to the first statement of the next case clause<br>B. To terminate the execution of the switch statement<br>C. To skip the current case and move to the next one without executing it<br>D. To create a loop within the switch statement,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The primary function of a fallthrough statement is to transfer control to the first statement of the next case clause in an expression switch statement. It allows the execution to continue into the next case, which can be useful for combining behaviors of multiple cases."
In which context can a fallthrough statement be used?<br><br>A. As the first statement in a case clause<br>B. As the last non-empty statement in a case clause<br>C. In any statement block within a function<br>D. Only in labeled statements,<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A fallthrough statement can only be used as the last non-empty statement in a case clause of an expression switch statement. This restriction ensures that it is clear when control will pass to the next case.
What happens if a fallthrough statement is placed in a case clause that is not the last statement?<br><br>A. It will cause a compile-time error<br>B. It will execute the next case statement immediately<br>C. It will be ignored and not executed<br>D. It will terminate the switch statement,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>If a fallthrough statement is placed in a case clause that is not the last statement, it will cause a compile-time error. This is because fallthrough statements are only valid as the last non-empty statement in a case clause."
What is the effect of using a fallthrough statement in a switch case?<br><br>A. It allows the current case to execute and then skips to the end of the switch<br>B. It allows the current case to execute and then continues executing the next case<br>C. It prevents the current case from executing<br>D. It exits the switch statement immediately,<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Using a fallthrough statement in a switch case allows the current case to execute and then continues executing the next case. This can be useful for cases that share common behavior without needing to repeat code.
What is the primary purpose of a defer statement in a function?<br><br>A. To execute a function immediately when called<br>B. To invoke a function after the surrounding function returns<br>C. To skip the execution of a function<br>D. To create a new goroutine for a function,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The primary purpose of a defer statement is to invoke a function after the surrounding function returns. This allows for cleanup actions or final operations to be performed just before the function exits, ensuring that they are executed regardless of how the function terminates."
When are deferred functions executed in relation to return statements?<br><br>A. Before any return statements are executed<br>B. After the return values are set but before the function returns<br>C. At the same time as the return statement<br>D. Only if the function panics,<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Deferred functions are executed after the return values are set but before the surrounding function returns to its caller. This ensures that any cleanup or finalization logic can access the return values that have just been established.
What happens if a deferred function evaluates to nil?<br><br>A. The function executes normally<br>B. The function panics when invoked<br>C. The function is skipped entirely<br>D. The function returns a default value,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>If a deferred function evaluates to nil, it causes a panic when the function is invoked, not at the time the defer statement is executed. This means that any potential errors related to nil values are only encountered when the deferred function is actually called."
How are multiple deferred functions executed when a surrounding function returns?<br><br>A. In the order they were declared<br>B. In reverse order of their declaration<br>C. All at once<br>D. Only the last one declared is executed,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Multiple deferred functions are executed in reverse order of their declaration. This means that the last deferred function declared will be the first one to execute when the surrounding function returns, allowing for a last-in, first-out execution pattern."
