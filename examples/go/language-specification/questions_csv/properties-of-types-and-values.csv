V must be a subtype of T.<br>D. V and T must have identical underlying types.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>For a value of type V to be assignable to a variable of type T, one of the conditions must be that V and T are identical types.

Which of the following conditions allows a value of type V to be assignable to an interface type T?<br><br>A. V is a named type and T is a type parameter.<br>B. V implements the methods defined by T.<br>C. V and T are both defined types.<br>D. V and T must be identical types.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A value of type V can be assigned to an interface type T if V implements the methods defined by T.

V is a defined type and T is an interface type.<br>D. V is a channel type and T is a channel type with identical element types.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>The condition that V is a defined type and T is an interface type does not guarantee assignability. Assignability requires that either V and T are identical, have identical underlying types, or meet other specific conditions related to channels or interfaces."
