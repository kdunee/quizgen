What does the Go language compatibility guarantee ensure?<br><br>A. Programs written to the Go 1 specification will continue to compile and run correctly over time.<br>B. All Go programs will run on any version of the Go language without modification.<br>C. New features in Go will automatically be compatible with all previous versions.<br>D. Go programs can only be compiled with the latest version of the Go language.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The Go language compatibility guarantee ensures that programs written to the Go 1 specification will continue to compile and run correctly, unchanged, over the lifetime of that specification. This means that as new features are added, existing programs will still function as intended without requiring modifications."
How does the compatibility guarantee affect programs written for specific Go versions?<br><br>A. They will not work with any future versions of Go.<br>B. They will continue to work with any subsequent version of Go.<br>C. They must be rewritten to accommodate new features.<br>D. They can only be run on the original version they were written for.,<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The compatibility guarantee ensures that a Go program that works with a specific version of the Go language will continue to work with any subsequent version.

What happens if a Go program uses features introduced in a later version of the language?<br><br>A. The program will compile successfully on any version of Go.<br>B. The program will be rejected if compiled with an older version of Go.<br>C. The program will run but may produce warnings.<br>D. The program will automatically adapt to the older version.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>If a Go program uses features that were introduced in a later version of the language, such as the prefix for binary integer literals introduced in Go 1.13, the program will be rejected if compiled with an older version of Go. This is because older versions do not recognize the new syntax or features."
What is the primary purpose of type unification in programming languages?<br><br>A. To determine if two types can be treated as the same type in a given context<br>B. To convert one type into another type automatically<br>C. To enforce strict type checking at all times<br>D. To simplify the syntax of type declarations,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The primary purpose of type unification is to determine if two types can be treated as the same type in a given context.

What happens when a bound type parameter and another type unify?<br><br>A. The bound type parameter is replaced by the other type<br>B. The unification process fails if the types are not identical<br>C. The type argument for the bound type parameter is inferred from the other type<br>D. The types are treated as completely separate and cannot interact,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>When a bound type parameter unifies with another type, the type argument for the bound type parameter is inferred from the other type if the bound type parameter does not have a known type argument. This allows for flexibility in type usage and ensures that the types can be used interchangeably when appropriate."

This means that developers can write functions and data structures that work with any type, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability."
How do generics in Go handle type safety?<br><br>A. By allowing any type to be used without restrictions.<br>B. By enforcing that all types used with generics must be identical.<br>C. By ensuring that type parameters are checked at compile time.<br>D. By requiring explicit type casting for all operations.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>Generics in Go handle type safety by ensuring that type parameters are checked at compile time. This means that any type used with a generic function or type must conform to the expected type constraints, helping to catch type-related errors before the program runs."
What is the primary purpose of type inference in programming languages?<br><br>A. To automatically determine the types of variables and expressions<br>B. To enforce strict type checking at compile time<br>C. To allow for dynamic typing of all variables<br>D. To convert types from one form to another explicitly,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The primary purpose of type inference is to automatically determine the types of variables and expressions based on their usage in the code.

"In the context of type inference, what does it mean for a type to be 'bound'?<br><br>A. The type is defined and cannot change<br>B. The type is associated with a specific value or type argument<br>C. The type is inferred from a variable's usage<br>D. The type is a primitive type that cannot be modified","<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A 'bound' type refers to a type that is associated with a specific value or type argument. This means that the type has been determined and is fixed in the context of its usage, as opposed to 'unbound' types, which can be inferred based on the context."
How does type inference handle unbound type parameters?<br><br>A. They are treated as any type without restrictions<br>B. They must always be explicitly defined by the programmer<br>C. They can be inferred based on the context in which they are used<br>D. They are automatically assigned a default type,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>Unbound type parameters can be inferred based on the context in which they are used. This means that the compiler analyzes how the type parameter is utilized in the code to determine its appropriate type, allowing for more flexible and dynamic programming."
What is the significance of the matching mode in type inference?<br><br>A. It determines how types are compared for equality<br>B. It specifies whether type parameters can be changed<br>C. It influences how types unify during the inference process<br>D. It restricts the types that can be used in a program,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>The matching mode in type inference influences how types unify during the inference process. It can be either 'exact' or 'loose', affecting how strictly types must match in order to be considered compatible, which is crucial for ensuring type safety in the code."

To provide a framework for error handling in Go programs,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The Go 1 compatibility guarantee ensures that programs written to the Go 1 specification will continue to compile and run correctly, unchanged, over the lifetime of that specification. This means that any program that works with a specific version will also work with subsequent versions, maintaining stability for developers."
How does the compatibility guarantee affect the use of new features in Go?<br><br>A. New features can be used without any restrictions in older programs<br>B. Older programs may need to be modified to use new features<br>C. Programs using older versions will not compile if they include new features<br>D. Programs will continue to work with new features as long as they adhere to the compatibility guarantee,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> D<br><br>The compatibility guarantee allows programs that adhere to the Go 1 specification to continue functioning correctly even as new features are introduced in later versions. This means that while older programs may not utilize new features, they will still compile and run without modification, ensuring a smooth transition to newer versions."
What happens if a program uses a feature introduced in a later version of Go?<br><br>A. The program will compile successfully in any version of Go<br>B. The program will be rejected by the compiler if an older version is used<br>C. The program will run but may produce unexpected results<br>D. The program will automatically update to the latest version of Go,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>If a program uses a feature that was introduced in a later version of Go, it will be rejected by the compiler if the version being used is older than the version that introduced that feature. This ensures that developers are aware of the version requirements for the features they are using."
