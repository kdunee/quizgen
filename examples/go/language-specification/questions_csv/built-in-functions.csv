It will have no effect (no-op).<br>D. It will initialize the slice with default values.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>Calling the 'clear' function on a nil slice is a no-op, meaning it has no effect.

Capacity is always zero for non-empty slices<br>D. Length and capacity are the same for all slices,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The relationship between the length and capacity of a slice is that the length can be equal to or less than the capacity. The capacity refers to the total number of elements that can be stored in the underlying array, while the length is the number of elements currently in the slice."
What happens if you attempt to append elements to a slice that does not have enough capacity?<br><br>A. The slice will automatically shrink in size<br>B. A run-time error will occur<br>C. A new underlying array will be allocated<br>D. The append operation will be ignored,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>If you attempt to append elements to a slice that does not have enough capacity, the 'append' function will allocate a new underlying array that is sufficiently large to accommodate both the existing elements and the new elements being added."

To create a new map with specified keys<br>D. To check if a key exists in a map,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The built-in function 'delete' is specifically designed to remove an element with a specified key from a map. If the key does not exist or if the map is nil, the function performs no operation, making it a safe way to attempt to remove an entry without causing an error."
What happens when the 'clear' function is called on a nil map in Go?<br><br>A. It deletes all entries in the map.<br>B. It returns an error.<br>C. It performs no operation.<br>D. It initializes the map with default values.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>When the 'clear' function is called on a nil map, it performs no operation.

What is the primary purpose of the built-in function 'close' in relation to channels?<br><br>A. To send values to the channel<br>B. To indicate that no more values will be sent on the channel<br>C. To receive values from the channel<br>D. To delete the channel from memory,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The primary purpose of the 'close' function is to indicate that no more values will be sent on the channel. This allows the receiving end to know when to stop waiting for new values, and it helps prevent sending to a closed channel, which would cause a run-time panic."
What happens if you attempt to close a nil channel using the 'close' function?<br><br>A. It successfully closes the channel without any issues.<br>B. It results in a run-time panic.<br>C. It simply does nothing and the program continues.<br>D. It returns an error message.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Attempting to close a nil channel results in a run-time panic. This is because the 'close' function expects a valid channel reference, and a nil channel does not meet this requirement."
What is the expected behavior of receive operations after a channel has been closed?<br><br>A. They will block until new values are sent.<br>B. They will return the zero value for the channel's type without blocking.<br>C. They will throw an error.<br>D. They will return the last value sent on the channel.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>After a channel has been closed, receive operations will return the zero value for the channel's type without blocking, provided that all previously sent values have been received. This allows the program to handle the end of data transmission gracefully."

What happens if the arguments to the 'complex' function are untyped constants?<br><br>A. They are treated as complex numbers.<br>B. They must be converted to the same floating-point type.<br>C. They will cause a compile-time error.<br>D. They are ignored by the function.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>If the arguments to the 'complex' function are untyped constants, they are first implicitly converted to the type of the other argument. This ensures that both arguments are of the same floating-point type before creating the complex number."

'len' returns the total allocated space for a slice, while 'cap' returns the number of elements in the slice.<br>C. 'len' can only be used with arrays, while 'cap' can be used with slices and maps.<br>D. 'len' returns the length of a string, while 'cap' returns the length of an array.","<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>In Go, the 'len' function returns the number of elements currently in a slice, while the 'cap' function returns the total capacity of the slice, which is the number of elements for which space has been allocated in the underlying array. This distinction is important for understanding memory usage and performance."
What happens if you call 'new' with a type that is not a variable type?<br><br>A. It will allocate memory but not return a pointer.<br>B. It will result in a compile-time error.<br>C. It will return a nil pointer.<br>D. It will allocate memory and return a pointer to the zero value.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Calling 'new' with a type that is not a variable type will result in a compile-time error. The 'new' function is specifically designed to allocate memory for variable types, and using it with non-variable types is not permitted in Go."

To recover from a run-time panic and continue execution<br>C. To allocate memory for a variable at run time<br>D. To print debugging information to the console,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The primary purpose of the 'panic' function in Go is to terminate the execution of the current function and report an error condition. When 'panic' is called, it triggers a sequence that unwinds the stack, executing deferred functions, and ultimately leads to program termination if not recovered."
What does the built-in function 'recover' do in Go?<br><br>A. It initiates a panic sequence in the program<br>B. It allows a program to manage the behavior of a panicking goroutine<br>C. It prints the current state of the program to the console<br>D. It allocates memory for a new variable,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>'Recover' is used in Go to manage the behavior of a panicking goroutine. It can be called within a deferred function to regain control after a panic has occurred, allowing the program to continue executing normally if handled properly."
"What happens when a function calls 'panic'?<br><br>A. The program continues executing without interruption<br>B. The function's execution is terminated, and deferred functions are executed<br>C. The function returns a value indicating success or failure<br>D. The program enters an infinite loop","<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>When a function calls 'panic', its execution is terminated immediately, and any deferred functions are executed in the order they were deferred. This unwinding process continues up the call stack until the program is either recovered or terminated."
What is a no-op in the context of the 'delete' function?<br><br>A. It performs a deletion operation successfully<br>B. It does nothing if the map is nil or the key does not exist<br>C. It returns an error if the key is not found<br>D. It creates a new map with the specified key,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>In the context of the 'delete' function, a no-op means that if the map is nil or the specified key does not exist in the map, the function does nothing and does not produce an error.

What is the relationship between the length and capacity of a slice?<br><br>A. Length can be greater than capacity<br>B. Length is always equal to capacity<br>C. Length is always less than or equal to capacity<br>D. Length and capacity are unrelated,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>The relationship between the length and capacity of a slice is that the length is always less than or equal to the capacity. This means that while the length indicates how many elements are currently in the slice, the capacity indicates how many elements can be stored in the slice's underlying array without needing to allocate more memory."
What happens to the length of a slice when it is cleared or set to nil?<br><br>A. The length becomes negative<br>B. The length remains unchanged<br>C. The length becomes zero<br>D. The length doubles,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>When a slice is cleared or set to nil, its length becomes zero.

"What happens if a type parameter is used with incompatible types?<br><br>A. The program will compile successfully but will fail at runtime.<br>B. The program will not compile, and an error will be raised.<br>C. The type parameter will be automatically converted to a compatible type.<br>D. The incompatible types will be ignored, and the program will run with default values.","<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>If a type parameter is used with incompatible types, the program will not compile, and an error will be raised. This ensures that type safety is maintained, preventing potential runtime errors due to type mismatches."
