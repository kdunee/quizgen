<p>
The syntax is specified using a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth_syntax_notation">variant</a>
of Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF):
</p>

<pre class="grammar">
Syntax      = { Production } .
Production  = production_name "=" [ Expression ] "." .
Expression  = Term { "|" Term } .
Term        = Factor { Factor } .
Factor      = production_name | token [ "…" token ] | Group | Option | Repetition .
Group       = "(" Expression ")" .
Option      = "[" Expression "]" .
Repetition  = "{" Expression "}" .
</pre>

<p>
Productions are expressions constructed from terms and the following
operators, in increasing precedence:
</p>
<pre class="grammar">
|   alternation
()  grouping
[]  option (0 or 1 times)
{}  repetition (0 to n times)
</pre>

<p>
Lowercase production names are used to identify lexical (terminal) tokens.
Non-terminals are in CamelCase. Lexical tokens are enclosed in
double quotes <code>""</code> or back quotes <code>``</code>.
</p>

<p>
The form <code>a … b</code> represents the set of characters from
<code>a</code> through <code>b</code> as alternatives. The horizontal
ellipsis <code>…</code> is also used elsewhere in the spec to informally denote various
enumerations or code snippets that are not further specified. The character <code>…</code>
(as opposed to the three characters <code>...</code>) is not a token of the Go
language.
</p>

<p>
A link of the form [<a href="#Language_versions">Go 1.xx</a>] indicates that a described
language feature (or some aspect of it) was changed or added with language version 1.xx and
thus requires at minimum that language version to build.
For details, see the <a href="#Language_versions">linked section</a>
in the <a href="#Appendix">appendix</a>.
