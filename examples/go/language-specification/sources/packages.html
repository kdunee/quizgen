<h2 id="Packages">Packages</h2>

<p>
Go programs are constructed by linking together <i>packages</i>.
A package in turn is constructed from one or more source files
that together declare constants, types, variables and functions
belonging to the package and which are accessible in all files
of the same package. Those elements may be
<a href="#Exported_identifiers">exported</a> and used in another package.
</p>

<h3 id="Source_file_organization">Source file organization</h3>

<p>
Each source file consists of a package clause defining the package
to which it belongs, followed by a possibly empty set of import
declarations that declare packages whose contents it wishes to use,
followed by a possibly empty set of declarations of functions,
types, variables, and constants.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
SourceFile       = PackageClause ";" { ImportDecl ";" } { TopLevelDecl ";" } .
</pre>

<h3 id="Package_clause">Package clause</h3>

<p>
A package clause begins each source file and defines the package
to which the file belongs.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
PackageClause  = "package" PackageName .
PackageName    = identifier .
</pre>

<p>
The PackageName must not be the <a href="#Blank_identifier">blank identifier</a>.
</p>

<pre>
package math
</pre>

<p>
A set of files sharing the same PackageName form the implementation of a package.
An implementation may require that all source files for a package inhabit the same directory.
</p>

<h3 id="Import_declarations">Import declarations</h3>

<p>
An import declaration states that the source file containing the declaration
depends on functionality of the <i>imported</i> package
(<a href="#Program_initialization_and_execution">§Program initialization and execution</a>)
and enables access to <a href="#Exported_identifiers">exported</a> identifiers
of that package.
The import names an identifier (PackageName) to be used for access and an ImportPath
that specifies the package to be imported.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
ImportDecl       = "import" ( ImportSpec | "(" { ImportSpec ";" } ")" ) .
ImportSpec       = [ "." | PackageName ] ImportPath .
ImportPath       = string_lit .
</pre>

<p>
The PackageName is used in <a href="#Qualified_identifiers">qualified identifiers</a>
to access exported identifiers of the package within the importing source file.
It is declared in the <a href="#Blocks">file block</a>.
If the PackageName is omitted, it defaults to the identifier specified in the
<a href="#Package_clause">package clause</a> of the imported package.
If an explicit period (<code>.</code>) appears instead of a name, all the
package's exported identifiers declared in that package's
<a href="#Blocks">package block</a> will be declared in the importing source
file's file block and must be accessed without a qualifier.
</p>

<p>
The interpretation of the ImportPath is implementation-dependent but
it is typically a substring of the full file name of the compiled
package and may be relative to a repository of installed packages.
</p>

<p>
Implementation restriction: A compiler may restrict ImportPaths to
non-empty strings using only characters belonging to
<a href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.3.0/">Unicode's</a>
L, M, N, P, and S general categories (the Graphic characters without
spaces) and may also exclude the characters
<code>!"#$%&amp;'()*,:;&lt;=&gt;?[\]^`{|}</code>
and the Unicode replacement character U+FFFD.
</p>

<p>
Consider a compiled a package containing the package clause
<code>package math</code>, which exports function <code>Sin</code>, and
installed the compiled package in the file identified by
<code>"lib/math"</code>.
This table illustrates how <code>Sin</code> is accessed in files
that import the package after the
various types of import declaration.
</p>

<pre class="grammar">
Import declaration          Local name of Sin

import   "lib/math"         math.Sin
import m "lib/math"         m.Sin
import . "lib/math"         Sin
</pre>

<p>
An import declaration declares a dependency relation between
the importing and imported package.
It is illegal for a package to import itself, directly or indirectly,
or to directly import a package without
referring to any of its exported identifiers. To import a package solely for
its side-effects (initialization), use the <a href="#Blank_identifier">blank</a>
identifier as explicit package name:
</p>

<pre>
import _ "lib/math"
</pre>


<h3 id="An_example_package">An example package</h3>

<p>
Here is a complete Go package that implements a concurrent prime sieve.
</p>

<pre>
package main

import "fmt"

// Send the sequence 2, 3, 4, … to channel 'ch'.
func generate(ch chan&lt;- int) {
	for i := 2; ; i++ {
		ch &lt;- i  // Send 'i' to channel 'ch'.
	}
}

// Copy the values from channel 'src' to channel 'dst',
// removing those divisible by 'prime'.
func filter(src &lt;-chan int, dst chan&lt;- int, prime int) {
	for i := range src {  // Loop over values received from 'src'.
		if i%prime != 0 {
			dst &lt;- i  // Send 'i' to channel 'dst'.
		}
	}
}

// The prime sieve: Daisy-chain filter processes together.
func sieve() {
	ch := make(chan int)  // Create a new channel.
	go generate(ch)       // Start generate() as a subprocess.
	for {
		prime := &lt;-ch
		fmt.Print(prime, "\n")
		ch1 := make(chan int)
		go filter(ch, ch1, prime)
		ch = ch1
	}
}

func main() {
	sieve()
}
