<h2 id="Blocks">Blocks</h2>

<p>
A <i>block</i> is a possibly empty sequence of declarations and statements
within matching brace brackets.
</p>

<pre class="ebnf">
Block = "{" StatementList "}" .
StatementList = { Statement ";" } .
</pre>

<p>
In addition to explicit blocks in the source code, there are implicit blocks:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>The <i>universe block</i> encompasses all Go source text.</li>

	<li>Each <a href="#Packages">package</a> has a <i>package block</i> containing all
	    Go source text for that package.</li>

	<li>Each file has a <i>file block</i> containing all Go source text
	    in that file.</li>

	<li>Each <a href="#If_statements">"if"</a>,
	    <a href="#For_statements">"for"</a>, and
	    <a href="#Switch_statements">"switch"</a>
	    statement is considered to be in its own implicit block.</li>

	<li>Each clause in a <a href="#Switch_statements">"switch"</a>
	    or <a href="#Select_statements">"select"</a> statement
	    acts as an implicit block.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Blocks nest and influence <a href="#Declarations_and_scope">scoping</a>.
