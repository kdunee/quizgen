<p>
Go is a general-purpose language designed with systems programming
in mind. It is strongly typed and garbage-collected and has explicit
support for concurrent programming.  Programs are constructed from
<i>packages</i>, whose properties allow efficient management of
dependencies.

<p>
The syntax is compact and simple to parse, allowing for easy analysis
by automatic tools such as integrated development environments.
