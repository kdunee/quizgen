        "explanation": "The valid representation of a rune literal must consist of a single character or an escape sequence. Therefore, '\\n' is valid as it represents a single character (newline), while 'abc' and 'Hello World' are invalid because they contain multiple characters."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In a rune literal, certain single-character escapes, such as '\\n' for newline or '\\t' for tab, can be used to represent special values. These backslash escapes allow for the encoding of specific characters that may not be easily typed."

        "correct_answer": "C",

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "An integer literal is defined as a sequence of digits that represents an integer constant. It can include optional prefixes to indicate different numeral systems, such as binary, octal, or hexadecimal, but fundamentally it is a representation of an integer value."

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The prefix '0b' or '0B' is used to indicate a binary integer literal. This allows the programmer to specify that the digits following the prefix are in base 2, distinguishing it from other numeral systems like octal (0o) or hexadecimal (0x)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of underscores in integer literals?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To separate different types of literals",
            "B": "To improve readability without changing the value",

            "D": "To denote a floating-point number"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Underscores in integer literals serve to improve readability by allowing the separation of groups of digits. They do not affect the actual value of the literal, making it easier for programmers to read and understand large numbers."

        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The format '12.34' is not a valid integer literal; it represents a floating-point number instead. Integer literals must consist solely of digits, possibly prefixed with a base indicator, and cannot include decimal points."

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A floating-point literal is defined as a decimal or hexadecimal representation of a floating-point constant. It can include an integer part, a decimal point, a fractional part, and an exponent part, allowing for the representation of real numbers in programming."

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A decimal floating-point literal can elide either the integer part or the fractional part, meaning that one of these components can be omitted. This flexibility allows for various valid representations of floating-point numbers."

        "question": "What is the purpose of the exponent part in a floating-point literal?",

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The exponent part in a floating-point literal serves to scale the mantissa (the integer and fractional part) by a power of ten. This allows for the representation of very large or very small numbers in a compact form."
    },
    {
        "question": "In a hexadecimal floating-point literal, which part is required?",

        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In a hexadecimal floating-point literal, the integer part is required. While the radix point and fractional part can be elided, the exponent part is mandatory to properly define the value in the hexadecimal format."

        "explanation": "An imaginary literal represents the imaginary part of a complex constant. It consists of an integer or floating-point literal followed by the letter 'i', indicating that the value is multiplied by the imaginary unit 'i'. This allows for the representation of complex numbers in programming."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "An imaginary literal is formatted as a numeric literal (either an integer or a floating-point literal) followed by the letter 'i'. This indicates that the numeric value represents the imaginary part of a complex number."

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If an imaginary literal's integer part consists entirely of decimal digits, it is treated as a decimal integer for backward compatibility. This means that even if it starts with a leading zero, it is still considered valid as a decimal integer."

        "explanation": "The example '3.14i' is a valid imaginary literal, as it consists of a floating-point number (3.14) followed by the letter 'i'. This indicates that it represents the imaginary part of a complex number. The other options do not conform to the format of an imaginary literal."
