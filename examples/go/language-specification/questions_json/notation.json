        "explanation": "Non-terminals represent abstract concepts or categories in syntax notation, while terminal tokens are specific values or symbols that are used directly in the language. Non-terminals are typically written in CamelCase, distinguishing them from terminal tokens, which are often in lowercase and enclosed in quotes."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Non-terminals serve the role of representing abstract structures in a production rule. They can be expanded into other productions, allowing for the creation of complex expressions and hierarchies within the syntax. This is essential for defining the grammar of a language."
