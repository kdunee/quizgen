        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A return statement is considered a terminating statement because it interrupts the regular flow of control in a block and causes the function to exit, potentially returning values to the caller. Other statements, such as assignments or expression statements, do not terminate the flow of control."
    },
    {
        "question": "In a 'for' statement, what happens if the condition is omitted?",

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For a send statement to execute successfully, the channel must permit send operations. This means that the channel must be properly initialized and not closed or nil. If the channel is unbuffered, the send operation will block until a receiver is ready; if it is buffered, it will block only if the buffer is full."

        "question": "Which of the following is a restriction when using a 'goto' statement?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It can only jump to labels within the same function.",
            "B": "It must always be used with a loop.",

            "D": "It cannot be used in conjunction with other control statements."
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A restriction when using a 'goto' statement is that it can only jump to labels within the same function. This means that the label must be defined in the same scope as the 'goto' statement, ensuring that the control flow remains within the same function context."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If a 'goto' statement attempts to jump to a label that is not in scope, the program will terminate with an error. This is because the jump would skip the creation of any variables that are defined in the scope of the label, leading to undefined behavior."

    {
        "question": "In which scenario is a 'goto' statement considered erroneous?",
        "options": {
            "A": "When it jumps to a label defined within the same function.",
            "B": "When it jumps to a label defined inside a block that is not in scope.",

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary function of a fallthrough statement is to transfer control to the first statement of the next case clause in an expression switch statement. It allows the execution to continue into the next case, which can be useful for combining behaviors of multiple cases."
    },
    {
        "question": "In which context can a fallthrough statement be used?",
        "options": {

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A fallthrough statement can only be used as the last non-empty statement in a case clause of an expression switch statement. This restriction ensures that it is clear when control will pass to the next case."

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If a fallthrough statement is placed in a case clause that is not the last statement, it will cause a compile-time error. This is because fallthrough statements are only valid as the last non-empty statement in a case clause."

    {
        "question": "What is the effect of using a fallthrough statement in a switch case?",
        "options": {

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using a fallthrough statement in a switch case allows the current case to execute and then continues executing the next case. This can be useful for cases that share common behavior without needing to repeat code."

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of a defer statement is to invoke a function after the surrounding function returns. This allows for cleanup actions or final operations to be performed just before the function exits, ensuring that they are executed regardless of how the function terminates."
    },
    {
        "question": "When are deferred functions executed in relation to return statements?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Before any return statements are executed",
            "B": "After the return values are set but before the function returns",
            "C": "At the same time as the return statement",
            "D": "Only if the function panics"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Deferred functions are executed after the return values are set but before the surrounding function returns to its caller. This ensures that any cleanup or finalization logic can access the return values that have just been established."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if a deferred function evaluates to nil?",
        "options": {
            "A": "The function executes normally",
            "B": "The function panics when invoked",
            "C": "The function is skipped entirely",
            "D": "The function returns a default value"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If a deferred function evaluates to nil, it causes a panic when the function is invoked, not at the time the defer statement is executed. This means that any potential errors related to nil values are only encountered when the deferred function is actually called."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are multiple deferred functions executed when a surrounding function returns?",
        "options": {
            "A": "In the order they were declared",

            "D": "Only the last one declared is executed"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Multiple deferred functions are executed in reverse order of their declaration. This means that the last deferred function declared will be the first one to execute when the surrounding function returns, allowing for a last-in, first-out execution pattern."
