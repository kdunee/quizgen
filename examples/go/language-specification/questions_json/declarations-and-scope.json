        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A declaration serves to bind a non-blank identifier to a specific entity such as a constant, type, variable, function, label, or package. This binding is essential for the identifier to be recognized and used within the program."

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The scope of a declared identifier refers to the extent of source text in which the identifier denotes the specified entity. This means that the identifier can be used within the defined scope but is not accessible outside of it."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When an identifier is declared in an inner block, it overrides the identifier in the outer block. While the inner declaration is in scope, it denotes the entity declared by the inner declaration, effectively shadowing the outer identifier."

        "explanation": "The scope of a declared identifier refers to the range of source text in which the identifier can be used to denote its associated constant, type, variable, function, label, or package. Understanding scope is crucial for managing identifier visibility and avoiding naming conflicts."

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "An identifier declared at the top level of a package has its scope limited to the entire package block. This means it can be accessed by any code within that package, but not outside of it unless it is exported."

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "An identifier declared in an inner block can hide an identifier from an outer block, meaning that within the inner block, the inner identifier takes precedence. This is a key aspect of lexical scoping in Go."

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The blank identifier, represented by the underscore character (_), is used to ignore values in declarations and assignments. It does not introduce a new binding and is useful for discarding values that are not needed."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If a variable declaration does not specify a type, the variable is initialized to its zero value based on the type of the corresponding initialization value. This allows for flexibility in variable declarations while ensuring that variables have a defined state."

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The zero value is significant in variable declarations because it is the value assigned to a variable when it is declared without an initializer. This ensures that the variable has a defined state, even if no explicit value is provided."
