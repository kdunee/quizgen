            "D": "undefined"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The zero value for a boolean type is 'false'. In programming, when a variable of boolean type is declared but not explicitly initialized, it automatically takes on the zero value, which is 'false'. This ensures that the variable has a defined state even before it is assigned a specific value."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens to a variable when it is declared without an explicit initialization?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It retains its previous value.",
            "B": "It is assigned a zero value based on its type.",

            "D": "It is assigned a random value."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a variable is declared without an explicit initialization, it is assigned a zero value based on its type. This means that for numeric types, it will be '0'; for strings, it will be an empty string (''); and for pointers, functions, and other reference types, it will be 'nil'. This behavior ensures that all variables have a predictable initial state."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which of the following types has a zero value of '0'?",
        "options": {
            "A": "String",

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The zero value for an integer type is '0'. In programming, each type has a specific zero value that is assigned when a variable of that type is declared without an explicit initialization. For integers, this zero value is '0', while other types have different zero values."

            "D": "The fields are set to null."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a struct is created without explicit initialization, each field of the struct is set to its zero value. This means that if the struct contains numeric fields, they will be initialized to '0'; boolean fields will be 'false'; and pointer fields will be 'nil'. This recursive initialization ensures that all fields have a defined state."

        "question": "What is the primary purpose of package initialization in a programming context?",

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of package initialization is to ensure that all package-level variables are assigned initial values before they are used. This process involves checking for dependencies and initializing variables in a specific order to avoid uninitialized variables, which is crucial for the program's validity."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the initialization order of package-level variables get determined?",
        "options": {
            "A": "By the alphabetical order of variable names",

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The initialization order of package-level variables is determined by the order in which they are declared in the source code. This declaration order is crucial for ensuring that variables are initialized correctly, especially when there are dependencies between them."

        "question": "What happens if there are uninitialized variables after the package initialization process?",
        "options": {
            "A": "The program will automatically assign default values to them",
            "B": "The program will terminate with an error",
            "C": "The uninitialized variables will be ignored during execution",
            "D": "The program will continue to run but with undefined behavior"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If there are uninitialized variables after the package initialization process, the program will terminate with an error. This is because uninitialized variables can lead to unpredictable behavior, and the programming language enforces initialization to maintain program integrity."

        "question": "What role do 'init' functions play in package initialization?",
        "options": {
            "A": "They are used to declare global variables",

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "'Init' functions are executed before any other functions in the package during the package initialization process. They allow for additional setup or configuration that may be necessary before the main logic of the package is executed, ensuring that the package is fully prepared for use."

            "D": "It is set to a random value."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a variable is allocated storage without explicit initialization, it is assigned a default zero value corresponding to its type. This means that for numeric types, it is set to 0; for booleans, it is false; for strings, it is an empty string; and for pointers and other reference types, it is nil."

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Package-level variable initialization occurs stepwise, selecting the earliest declared variable that has no dependencies on uninitialized variables. This ensures that variables are initialized in a logical order, respecting their dependencies."

            "D": "It is a special function that initializes the entire package after variable initialization."
        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The 'init' function is a special function that is called after all package-level variables have been initialized. It allows for additional setup or initialization tasks to be performed, and multiple 'init' functions can exist within a package, executing in the order they appear in the source code."

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If there are any uninitialized variables remaining at the end of the initialization process, the program is considered invalid. This indicates that there are initialization cycles or dependencies that were not resolved, preventing the program from compiling successfully."

        "correct_answer": "C",
