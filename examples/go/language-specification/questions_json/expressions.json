        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A blank identifier can only appear on the left-hand side of an assignment statement. It is used to ignore values that are not needed, allowing the programmer to discard unwanted results without causing a compile-time error."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A variable name is an example of an operand as it represents a value that can be used in expressions. In contrast, function declarations, operators, and type declarations do not represent values directly and thus are not considered operands."

        "explanation": "In the expression 'y[f()], ok = g(z || h(), i()+x[j()], <-c), k()', the function f() is guaranteed to be evaluated first because it is the first operand in the assignment. The evaluation order of function calls is determined by their position in the expression, and f() appears before g() and k()."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "At the package level, initialization dependencies determine the evaluation order of individual initialization expressions. This means that the order of evaluation can be influenced by the dependencies between variables, overriding the left-to-right evaluation rule that applies to function-local expressions."
