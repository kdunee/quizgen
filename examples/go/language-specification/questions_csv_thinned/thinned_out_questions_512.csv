Which of the following must be true for a send statement to execute successfully?<br><br>A. The channel must be closed<br>B. The channel must be nil<br>C. The channel must permit send operations<br>D. The value must be a constant,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>For a send statement to execute successfully, the channel must permit send operations. This means that the channel must be properly initialized and not closed or nil. If the channel is unbuffered, the send operation will block until a receiver is ready; if it is buffered, it will block only if the buffer is full."
What happens if a send statement is executed on a closed channel?<br><br>A. The program continues without any issues<br>B. The send operation is ignored<br>C. The program panics at runtime<br>D. The value is sent to the next available receiver,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>If a send statement is executed on a closed channel, it causes a runtime panic. This is because sending on a closed channel is not allowed in Go, and the language enforces this rule to prevent undefined behavior and ensure safe communication between goroutines."
"In a send statement, what must be true about the value being sent?<br><br>A. It must be a pointer type<br>B. It must be a global variable<br>C. It must be assignable to the channel's element type<br>D.

What does the '<-' operator signify when used with channels?<br><br>A. It indicates the type of data being sent through the channel<br>B. It specifies the direction of communication for the channel<br>C. It denotes the capacity of the channel<br>D. It represents the initialization of the channel,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The '<-' operator specifies the direction of communication for the channel. It can indicate whether the channel is meant for sending values, receiving values, or both, thus defining its operational behavior."
What happens when a channel is created with a capacity of zero?<br><br>A. The channel can store an unlimited number of values<br>B. The channel is unbuffered and communication requires both sender and receiver to be ready<br>C. The channel can only send values but not receive them<br>D. The channel is automatically closed after the first value is sent,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>When a channel is created with a capacity of zero, it is unbuffered, meaning that communication will only succeed when both a sender and a receiver are ready. This ensures synchronization between the two operations."
Which of the following statements is true about a nil channel?<br><br>A. A nil channel can be used for sending and receiving values<br>B. A nil channel is equivalent to an empty channel but cannot have elements added<br>C. A nil channel can be initialized with a specific capacity<br>D. A nil channel is always ready for communication,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A nil channel is equivalent to an empty channel in that it cannot have elements added to it. However, unlike an empty channel, a nil channel is never ready for communication, making it unusable for sending or receiving values."
What determines the set of permissible values for a variable?<br><br>A. The variable's name<br>B. The variable's type<br>C. The variable's scope<br>D. The variable's declaration order,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The set of permissible values for a variable is determined by the variable's type. Each type defines the kind of data that can be stored in the variable, such as integers, strings, or more complex structures."
"What is the difference between static type and dynamic type of a variable?<br><br>A. Static type is determined at runtime, while dynamic type is fixed.<br>B. Static type is the type given in the declaration, while dynamic type is the type of the value assigned at runtime.<br>C. Static type can change during execution, while dynamic type cannot.<br>D. Static type is only applicable to interface variables, while dynamic type applies to all variables.","<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The static type of a variable is the type specified in its declaration, while the dynamic type is the actual type of the value assigned to the variable at runtime. This distinction is important for understanding how variables can interact with different types of data."
What happens if a variable has not yet been assigned a value?<br><br>A. It holds a random value.<br>B. It holds the last assigned value.<br>C. It holds the zero value for its type.<br>D. It causes a runtime error.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>If a variable has not yet been assigned a value, it holds the zero value for its type. This zero value is a default state that ensures variables have a defined value before they are explicitly assigned a different one."
Which of the following statements is true regarding the dynamic type of a variable?<br><br>A. It is always the same as the static type<br>B. It can change during program execution<br>C. It is determined at compile time<br>D. It cannot be assigned to the static type,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The dynamic type of a variable can change during program execution. It refers to the actual type of the value assigned to the variable at runtime, which may differ from the static type defined at declaration. This allows for flexibility in how variables can be used in a program."
Which of the following statements is true regarding static types?<br><br>A. Static types can change dynamically during program execution.<br>B. Static types are determined by the values assigned to the variable.<br>C. Static types are defined at compile time and do not change.<br>D. Static types are only relevant for interface types.,<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>Static types are defined at compile time and do not change during the execution of the program. They provide a way to ensure type safety by specifying what type of values a variable can hold.
"What happens to a variable's dynamic type when it is assigned the predeclared identifier 'nil'?<br><br>A. The dynamic type becomes the static type of the variable.<br>B. The dynamic type is undefined.<br>C. The dynamic type is nil, which has no type.<br>D. The dynamic type is set to the last assigned value.","<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>When a variable is assigned the predeclared identifier 'nil', its dynamic type becomes nil, which has no type. This indicates that the variable does not currently hold a value of any specific type, distinguishing it from other values that have defined types."
What is pointer indirection in the context of variables?<br><br>A. A method to directly access a variable's value without using its name<br>B. A technique to allocate storage for a variable at compile time<br>C. A way to refer to a variable's storage location using its address<br>D. A process that converts a variable's type from static to dynamic,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>Pointer indirection refers to the method of accessing a variable's storage location using its address. This allows for the manipulation of the variable's value indirectly, which is essential in scenarios where direct access is not possible or when working with dynamic memory allocation."
When is pointer indirection typically used?<br><br>A. When declaring a variable's type<br>B. When allocating storage for a variable at runtime<br>C. When retrieving a variable's value directly<br>D. When defining a function's return type,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Pointer indirection is typically used when allocating storage for a variable at runtime. This is done through functions like 'new' or by taking the address of a composite literal, allowing for dynamic memory management and the ability to reference variables indirectly."
What defines the elements and fields of structured variables?<br><br>A. They can only hold primitive data types.<br>B. They may be addressed individually.<br>C. They are always of the same type.<br>D. They cannot be modified after creation.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Structured variables, such as arrays, slices, and structs, have elements and fields that can be addressed individually. This means that each element or field can be accessed and manipulated separately, allowing for more complex data structures."
Which of the following is NOT a type of structured variable?<br><br>A. Array<br>B. Slice<br>C. Integer<br>D. Struct,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>An integer is a primitive data type, not a structured variable. Structured variables include types like arrays, slices, and structs, which can hold multiple values or fields and allow for individual addressing of those components."
