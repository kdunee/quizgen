        "options": {
            "A": "To copy files from an archive to the local file system",
            "B": "To compress files into a single archive",
            "C": "To delete files from the local file system",
            "D": "To create a new archive from existing files"
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of unpacking archives in Gradle is to copy files from an archive (such as a ZIP or TAR file) to the local file system. This process allows users to access the contents of the archive as if they were regular files and directories."

        "question": "Which method is used in Gradle to create a file tree from a ZIP archive?",
        "options": {
            "A": "fileTree()",
            "B": "zipTree()",
            "C": "tarTree()",
            "D": "copy()"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In Gradle, the method used to create a file tree from a ZIP archive is zipTree(). This method allows users to treat the contents of the ZIP file as a hierarchical collection of files, which can then be manipulated or copied as needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens to the directory structure when unpacking an archive using Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "The directory structure is flattened into a single directory.",
            "B": "The directory structure is preserved as it is in the archive.",
            "C": "Only the root directory of the archive is unpacked.",
            "D": "The directory structure is ignored, and only files are copied."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When unpacking an archive using Gradle, the directory structure is preserved as it is in the archive. This means that all files and subdirectories within the archive are recreated in the destination directory, maintaining the original hierarchy."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you filter which files to unpack from an archive in Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "By using the include() and exclude() methods in the copy specification.",
            "B": "By renaming files before unpacking.",
            "C": "By changing the archive format.",
            "D": "By modifying the archive's metadata."
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In Gradle, you can filter which files to unpack from an archive by using the include() and exclude() methods in the copy specification. This allows you to specify patterns for which files should be included or excluded during the unpacking process."
