        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of collections in Gradle is to manage and maintain groups of objects, particularly in the context of build scripts and plugins. These collections allow for organized handling of tasks, configurations, and custom domain objects, facilitating easier manipulation and access."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The `DomainObjectSet` in Gradle is designed to hold a set of objects where duplicate elements are not allowed. This ensures that each object in the set is unique, which is essential for managing collections effectively in build scripts."

        "explanation": "The key distinction of a `NamedDomainObjectSet` is that it associates each object with a unique name, allowing for easier identification and access. In contrast, a `DomainObjectSet` does not have this naming feature and simply holds a set of objects without any associated names."
