            "D": "To ensure all projects are configured regardless of the tasks"
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of configuration on demand in Gradle is to configure only the relevant projects for the requested tasks. This approach reduces configuration time in large multi-project builds by evaluating only the necessary build script files, thus improving overall build performance."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A potential drawback of using configuration on demand is that it may lead to flawed build outcomes if projects are coupled. Coupling can occur when projects directly modify or read each other's configurations, which can interfere with the optimizations that configuration on demand aims to achieve."

    {
        "question": "In which scenario is configuration on demand most effective?",
        "options": {
            "A": "When all projects are tightly coupled.",

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Configuration on demand is most effective in large multi-project builds with decoupled projects. This setup allows Gradle to optimize the configuration process by only evaluating the necessary projects, thus enhancing build efficiency while avoiding issues related to project coupling."

        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Decoupled projects in Gradle are characterized by their interaction solely through declared dependencies and task dependencies. This means that they do not directly modify or read each other's configurations, which helps to avoid coupling issues that can lead to flawed build outcomes."

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "To avoid coupling issues in Gradle, it is recommended to prefer cross-configuration from the root project. This approach minimizes direct interactions between subprojects, thereby reducing the risk of coupling that can lead to build problems."

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A critical consideration when using parallel execution in Gradle is that task dependencies and inputs/outputs must be correctly declared. This ensures that tasks are executed in the correct order and that dependencies are respected, preventing potential issues during the build process."

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of declaring task dependencies in Gradle is to ensure that tasks are executed in a specific order. This is important because some tasks may rely on the outputs of others, and declaring dependencies helps Gradle understand the sequence in which tasks should be executed to achieve the desired build outcome."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If task dependencies are not correctly declared in a Gradle build, tasks may execute out of order, which can lead to potential build failures. Properly declaring dependencies ensures that tasks that rely on the outputs of other tasks are executed only after those tasks have completed successfully."
