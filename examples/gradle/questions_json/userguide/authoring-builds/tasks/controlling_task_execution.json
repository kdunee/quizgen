        "explanation": "The purpose of task dependencies in Gradle is to ensure that tasks are executed in a specific order based on their dependencies. This means that if one task relies on the output of another, Gradle will automatically manage the execution order to ensure that the dependent task runs only after its prerequisites have completed."

        "question": "What is the purpose of excluding a task from execution in Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To prevent the task from being executed while allowing other tasks to run",
            "B": "To ensure that all tasks are executed in parallel",
            "C": "To automatically delete the task from the build script",
            "D": "To create a new task that replaces the excluded task"
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Excluding a task from execution allows you to run other tasks without executing the specified task. This can be useful when you want to skip certain tasks that may not be necessary for a particular build, but it can lead to unexpected outcomes if the excluded task produces results needed by other tasks."

        "question": "Which command-line option is used to exclude a task from execution in Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "--skip-task",
            "B": "--exclude-task",

            "D": "--ignore-task"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The `--exclude-task` command-line option is used to specify a task that should be excluded from execution. This allows you to run a build while omitting specific tasks, which can be useful in various scenarios."

    {
        "question": "What is a potential risk of using the exclude task feature in Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It may cause the build to fail immediately.",
            "B": "It can lead to unexpected outcomes if the excluded task is needed by other tasks.",
            "C": "It will automatically remove the task from the build script.",
            "D": "It will prevent all tasks from executing."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Excluding a task can lead to unexpected outcomes, particularly if the excluded task produces results that are required by other tasks in the build process. This can result in incomplete builds or errors during execution."

    {
        "question": "What is the recommended practice instead of frequently using the exclude task option?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To define a suitable lifecycle task for the desired action.",
            "B": "To always run all tasks regardless of their necessity.",
            "C": "To create a new project for each build.",
            "D": "To manually delete tasks from the build script."
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Instead of frequently using the exclude task option, it is recommended to define a suitable lifecycle task for the desired action. This approach helps maintain clarity in the build process and ensures that necessary tasks are executed without relying on exclusions."
