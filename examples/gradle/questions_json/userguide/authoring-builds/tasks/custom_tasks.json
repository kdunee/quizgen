        "options": {
            "A": "To ensure all input files are processed every time a task runs",
            "B": "To improve build performance by processing only out-of-date inputs",
            "C": "To eliminate the need for task dependencies",
            "D": "To automatically generate output files for all inputs"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The primary benefit of using incremental tasks in Gradle is to improve build performance by processing only out-of-date inputs. This means that if only a few input files have changed, the task will only reprocess those files instead of all inputs, leading to faster build times."

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To process inputs incrementally, a task must contain the @Incremental annotation. This annotation indicates that the task action will only process the changed inputs, allowing Gradle to optimize the build process."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The primary benefit of using incremental tasks is to improve build performance by processing only the input files that have changed since the last execution. This avoids unnecessary reprocessing of unchanged inputs, making the build process more efficient."

        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "When the task is executed with the `--rerun-tasks` option, Gradle treats all input files as 'ADDED', regardless of their actual state. This is because the option forces a non-incremental execution, meaning that Gradle cannot determine which inputs are out-of-date based on previous executions."
