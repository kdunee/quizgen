        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of the Build Cache in Gradle is to store build artifacts for reuse in future builds. This helps to avoid redundant work by caching outputs of tasks, which can significantly speed up the build process when the same tasks are executed again."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The command used to enable the Build Cache during a Gradle build is '--build-cache'. This argument instructs Gradle to utilize the Build Cache, allowing it to check for cached outputs and potentially speed up the build process."

        "question": "What should be done to ensure the Build Cache is clean between tests?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Use a permanent directory for the cache",

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To ensure the Build Cache is clean between tests, it is recommended to configure the local build cache to use a temporary directory. This approach allows for automatic cleanup of the cache, preventing any interference between test runs."

        "question": "What is a potential outcome when a task is executed using the Build Cache?",
        "options": {
            "A": "TaskOutcome.FROM_CACHE",

            "D": "TaskOutcome.UP-TO-DATE"
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When a task is executed using the Build Cache, a potential outcome is 'TaskOutcome.FROM_CACHE'. This indicates that the task's output was retrieved from the cache rather than being executed again, which can improve build efficiency."
