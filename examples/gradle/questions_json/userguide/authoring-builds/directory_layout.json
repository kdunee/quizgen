            "D": "To execute Gradle build scripts directly."
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Gradle User Home directory is primarily used to store global configuration properties, initialization scripts, caches, and log files. It serves as a central location for Gradle to manage its settings and resources, distinct from the project-specific files."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which of the following best describes the cleanup process for caches in the Gradle User Home?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Caches are cleaned up only when a new version of Gradle is installed.",

    },
    {
        "question": "How can users configure the cache cleanup settings in the Gradle User Home?",
        "options": {
            "A": "By modifying the Gradle installation directory directly.",

            "D": "It is merged with the global cache directory"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "After building the project, Gradle automatically checks the project-specific cache directory to determine if version-specific caches have been used. If they haven't been used for 7 days, they are deleted, ensuring that the cache remains relevant and does not consume unnecessary space."
