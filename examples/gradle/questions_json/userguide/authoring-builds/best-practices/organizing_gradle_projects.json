        "explanation": "A key component of a custom Gradle distribution is the inclusion of initialization scripts that apply specific build logic across all projects. These scripts help enforce common conventions and rules, ensuring that all developers follow the same setup and configuration practices."

            "A": "It allows for the use of any version of Gradle without restrictions",
            "B": "It simplifies the process of applying consistent build logic across projects",
            "C": "It eliminates the need for a gradle.properties file",

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "One of the benefits of using a custom Gradle distribution is that it simplifies the process of applying consistent build logic across projects. By bundling initialization scripts with the distribution, organizations can ensure that all projects adhere to the same standards and configurations, reducing discrepancies and improving maintainability."

        "question": "How does a custom Gradle distribution affect the gradle.properties file?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It makes the gradle.properties file obsolete",
            "B": "It can include a gradle.properties file for organization-wide properties",
            "C": "It requires a separate gradle.properties file for each project",
            "D": "It prevents the use of gradle.properties files altogether"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A custom Gradle distribution can include a gradle.properties file that provides organization-wide properties controlling the build environment. This allows for centralized management of properties that can be applied to all projects using the custom distribution, enhancing consistency and ease of configuration."
