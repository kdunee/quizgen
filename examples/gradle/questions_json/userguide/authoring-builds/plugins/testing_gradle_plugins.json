        "question": "Which of the following best describes the role of automated testing in build automation?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It replaces the need for manual testing entirely.",
            "B": "It allows developers to refactor code with confidence.",
            "C": "It is only necessary for large projects.",
            "D": "It complicates the build process unnecessarily."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Automated testing plays a crucial role in build automation by allowing developers to refactor and improve code with confidence. It provides a safety net that ensures the software continues to function correctly after changes are made, thus maintaining quality throughout the development process."

    {
        "question": "What is the testing pyramid in the context of build automation?",
        "options": {
            "A": "A model that emphasizes the importance of manual testing.",
            "B": "A framework for organizing different types of automated tests.",
            "C": "A method for increasing the number of integration tests.",
            "D": "A strategy for reducing the number of unit tests."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The testing pyramid is a framework for organizing different types of automated tests, typically consisting of unit tests at the base, integration tests in the middle, and functional tests at the top. This model emphasizes having a larger number of unit tests, fewer integration tests, and even fewer functional tests to ensure comprehensive coverage while maintaining efficiency."

        "question": "What is the significance of source sets in Gradle build automation?",
        "options": {
            "A": "They define the user interface of the application.",
            "B": "They specify the directories containing source code for different types of tests.",
            "C": "They are used exclusively for manual testing.",
            "D": "They determine the deployment strategy of the application."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Source sets in Gradle build automation specify the directories containing source code for different types of tests, such as unit, integration, and functional tests. This organization helps maintain a clear structure within the project, making it easier to manage and execute tests effectively."
