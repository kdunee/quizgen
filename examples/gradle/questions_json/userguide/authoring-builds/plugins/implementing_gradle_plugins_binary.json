            "A": "Warning and Error",
            "B": "Recoverable and Non-recoverable",

            "D": "Informational and Debug"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gradle supports two modes of problem reporting: recoverable problems, where the build should continue, and non-recoverable problems, where the build should fail. This distinction allows developers to handle issues appropriately based on their severity."

        "question": "What happens when a problem is reported multiple times in Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Each occurrence is reported separately without aggregation.",
            "B": "Only the first occurrence is reported, and subsequent occurrences are aggregated.",
            "C": "All occurrences are ignored after the first.",
            "D": "The build process is halted after the first occurrence."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a problem is reported multiple times in Gradle, the first occurrence is reported with complete information, while subsequent occurrences are aggregated. This aggregation helps in managing and summarizing similar problems effectively."

        "question": "What is recommended for the namespace when creating a problem reporter in Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "A random string to ensure uniqueness",
            "B": "The plugin ID for consistency",
            "C": "The name of the project",
            "D": "A generic term like 'problemReporter'"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "It is recommended to use the plugin ID as the namespace when creating a problem reporter in Gradle. This practice ensures consistency and helps in identifying the source of the reported problems."

        "question": "What is the primary purpose of a custom `dependencies` block in a Gradle plugin?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To allow users to declare dependencies in a type-safe and context-aware manner",
            "B": "To automatically resolve all dependencies without user input",
            "C": "To provide a flat list of all dependencies used in the project",
            "D": "To restrict the types of dependencies that can be added to a project"
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of a custom `dependencies` block in a Gradle plugin is to allow users to declare dependencies in a type-safe and context-aware manner. This enhances usability by providing meaningful names for dependency scopes and ensuring that users can add dependencies without needing to know the underlying configuration names."

        "options": {
            "A": "Custom blocks can only accept string inputs for dependencies.",
            "B": "Custom blocks do not allow for lazy dependency declarations.",
            "C": "Dependencies in custom blocks must be declared using specific methods rather than map notation.",
            "D": "Custom blocks automatically resolve dependencies without user intervention."
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A key difference between a custom `dependencies` block and the top-level `dependencies` block is that dependencies in custom blocks must be declared using specific methods rather than map notation. This ensures a more structured and type-safe approach to adding dependencies."

        "question": "What is the benefit of using a custom `dependencies` block in a Gradle plugin?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It simplifies the process of adding dependencies by using a single method for all types.",
            "B": "It allows for the declaration of dependencies without any underlying configuration.",
            "C": "It provides a more organized and context-aware way to manage dependencies.",
            "D": "It eliminates the need for any user-defined dependency management."
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The benefit of using a custom `dependencies` block in a Gradle plugin is that it provides a more organized and context-aware way to manage dependencies. This structure helps users understand the purpose of each dependency and ensures that they are added correctly within the context of the plugin."

    {
        "question": "When creating a custom `dependencies` block, what is a necessary step to ensure that dependencies are properly resolved?",
        "options": {
            "A": "The custom block must be named 'dependencies' to function correctly.",
            "B": "The plugin must wire the custom block to underlying `Configuration` objects.",
            "C": "The custom block should only accept string inputs for dependency names.",
            "D": "The custom block must be defined in the root project build file."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To ensure that dependencies declared in a custom `dependencies` block are properly resolved, the plugin must wire the custom block to underlying `Configuration` objects. This connection allows the declared dependencies to be recognized and managed by Gradle's dependency resolution system."
