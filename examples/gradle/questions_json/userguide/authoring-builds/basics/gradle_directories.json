        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Project source files are not found in the Gradle User Home directory; instead, they are located in the project root directory. The Gradle User Home is meant for global settings and caches, while the project root contains the actual source files and project-specific configurations."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The location of the Gradle User Home directory can be changed by setting the environment variable GRADLE_USER_HOME. This allows users to specify a different directory for Gradle's global configuration and cache files, which can be useful for managing multiple projects or environments."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The primary benefit of using incremental builds in Gradle is to speed up the build process by only recompiling files that have changed since the last build. This approach reduces the overall build time and improves efficiency, as it avoids unnecessary recompilation of unchanged files."

        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The `.gradle` directory within the Project Root is primarily associated with storing project-specific cache data for incremental builds. This directory contains version-specific caches that help Gradle determine which files need to be rebuilt, thus facilitating the incremental build process."

    {
        "question": "How does Gradle determine which files need to be rebuilt during an incremental build?",
        "options": {
            "A": "By checking the last modified timestamps of all files",
            "B": "By recompiling all files regardless of changes",

        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gradle determines which files need to be rebuilt during an incremental build by checking the last modified timestamps of the files. This allows Gradle to identify which files have changed since the last build and only recompile those, thereby optimizing the build process."

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Gradle Wrapper contributes to build consistency by allowing users to specify the exact version of Gradle required for the project. This ensures that all developers and build environments use the same version, reducing discrepancies and potential issues during the build process."
