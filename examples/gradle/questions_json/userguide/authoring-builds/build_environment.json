        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The methods for configuring Gradle behavior are evaluated in the following order of precedence: Command line, System properties, Gradle properties, and Environment variables. This means that if a configuration is specified in multiple places, the first one found in this order will take precedence."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When resolving Gradle properties, the order of precedence is Command line, Gradle properties file, and then Environment variables. This means that if a property is defined in multiple locations, the value from the command line will take precedence over those defined in properties files or environment variables."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a property is defined in both a Gradle properties file and as a command line argument, the command line argument will take effect. This is due to the precedence rules in Gradle, where command line configurations are prioritized over those set in properties files."
