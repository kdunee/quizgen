    {
        "question": "How can you change the JVM settings for the command line client in Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "By modifying the `org.gradle.jvmargs` property",
            "B": "By setting the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable",

        "question": "What happens when the Gradle Daemon is deactivated?",
        "options": {
            "A": "The client VM will always use the same settings as the build VM",
