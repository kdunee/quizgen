            "D": "To simplify the build script syntax"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The main purpose of the Isolated Projects feature in Gradle is to improve performance by isolating project configurations. This isolation prevents build logic from accessing the mutable state of other projects, allowing for parallel execution and independent caching of project configurations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when Isolated Projects is enabled and build logic attempts to access another project's state?",
        "options": {
            "A": "The build will succeed without any issues",
            "B": "Gradle will ignore the access attempt",
            "C": "The build will fail and report the access problem",
            "D": "Gradle will automatically resolve the access issue"
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When Isolated Projects is enabled and build logic attempts to access another project's state, the build will fail, and Gradle will report the access problem. This is a key feature designed to maintain the isolation of project configurations and ensure safe parallel execution."

    {
        "question": "Which of the following statements is true regarding the caching mechanism in Isolated Projects?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Only fine-grained caching is used during IDE sync",
            "B": "Coarse-grained caching is applied first, followed by fine-grained caching if necessary",
            "C": "Caching is not applicable to IDE sync operations",
            "D": "Caching is only available for remote builds"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In Isolated Projects, the caching mechanism begins with coarse-grained caching, where the entire sync operation result is cached. If changes occur that affect the IDE model, Gradle then falls back to fine-grained caching, which caches the results of creating tooling models for each project."
    },

        "question": "What is a limitation of the Isolated Projects feature as mentioned in the chapter?",

            "D": "It requires a specific version of Java to function"
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A limitation of the Isolated Projects feature is that parallel configuration and fine-grained caching are only applied to IDE sync and do not extend to task execution. This means that while project configurations can be isolated and cached during sync, task execution does not benefit from these optimizations."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of the configuration cache in Gradle is to improve performance by caching the results of build configuration. This allows Gradle to reuse previously computed results, reducing the time needed for subsequent builds when the configuration has not changed."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the configuration cache handle changes in build scripts?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It ignores changes and continues using the cached results",
            "B": "It invalidates the cache and requires a full rebuild",
            "C": "It only updates the cache for unchanged projects",
            "D": "It automatically updates all project dependencies"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When changes are made to build scripts, the configuration cache invalidates the cached results. This means that Gradle will not reuse the previous cache entry and will require a full rebuild to ensure that the changes are properly reflected in the build process."

    {
        "question": "What happens when the configuration cache is reused during an IDE sync?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Gradle performs a full configuration of all projects",
            "B": "Gradle short-circuits the sync operation and returns cached results",

            "D": "Gradle updates all project dependencies automatically"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When the configuration cache is reused during an IDE sync, Gradle short-circuits the sync operation and returns the cached results. This means that if nothing affecting the IDE model has changed, Gradle can skip the configuration phase, leading to faster sync times."

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "One of the limitations of the configuration cache in Gradle is that it does not support remote caching. All caching, including the configuration cache, is done locally on the machine, which can limit its effectiveness in distributed build environments."

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The primary benefit of enabling parallel configuration in Gradle is to improve the performance of the build process. By allowing projects to be configured simultaneously, Gradle can reduce the overall time taken for builds, especially in multi-project setups."

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Parallel configuration in Gradle enables projects to be configured independently and in parallel. This means that each project's configuration can occur simultaneously, leading to faster build times, while ensuring that build logic does not access the mutable state of other projects."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a project's configuration changes in the context of parallel configuration, only the changed project is reconfigured. This selective reconfiguration helps maintain efficiency by avoiding unnecessary work on projects that have not changed."

            "D": "It allows unrestricted access to other projects' states."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A limitation of the current implementation of parallel configuration in Gradle is that it does not apply to task execution; it is only applied to IDE sync. This means that while project configuration can occur in parallel, the execution of tasks still follows the traditional sequential model."

        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Under the build logic constraints of Isolated Projects, the method getName() is allowed because it returns immutable information about the project. In contrast, methods that attempt to modify or access mutable state, such as setState() or updateProject(), are restricted to maintain isolation between projects."

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When build logic attempts to cross project boundaries in Isolated Projects, Gradle fails the build and collects all access problems in the configuration cache report. This mechanism is in place to enforce the isolation of projects and ensure that build configurations do not interfere with one another."

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A limitation of the Isolated Projects feature is that it does not exploit the isolation to limit peak memory consumption. Currently, the peak memory usage is determined by the number of projects that need to be configured, which can lead to higher memory consumption during the build process."

        "explanation": "Gradle lifecycle callbacks are designed to allow plugin authors and build engineers to register actions that will be executed at specific points in the build lifecycle, such as before or after a project is configured. This enables more control over the build process and can lead to performance optimizations."
