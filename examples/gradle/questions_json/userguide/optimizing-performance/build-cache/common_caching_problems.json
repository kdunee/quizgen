        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using symbolic links can lead to cache misses because Gradle stores the actual file contents of the destination rather than the link itself. If the content of the destination changes, it can affect the cacheability of tasks that depend on those links."

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using volatile inputs like timestamps can lead to non-repeatable task outputs, which negatively affects the effectiveness of the build cache. If the outputs vary for the same inputs, it can result in cache misses and inconsistent builds."

            "A": "Use dynamic dependencies that change frequently.",
            "B": "Track only the major version of dependencies.",

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "To ensure stable task inputs in a Gradle build, it is crucial to avoid using volatile data and to ensure that inputs are consistent across builds. This helps maintain cache effectiveness and prevents issues with task outputs."
