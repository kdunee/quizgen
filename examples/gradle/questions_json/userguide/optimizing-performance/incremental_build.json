        "options": {
            "A": "It makes the input mandatory for the task to execute.",
            "B": "It allows the task to run even if the input file does not exist.",

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using the `@Optional` annotation on a task input allows the task to run even if the input file does not exist. This is useful for scenarios where the absence of the input is acceptable and should not prevent the task from executing."

        "explanation": "The runtime API in Gradle is designed to allow users to declare inputs and outputs for tasks that do not have access to annotations, such as ad-hoc tasks or when the source code for a custom task class is not available. This enables the same incremental build benefits as using annotations."
