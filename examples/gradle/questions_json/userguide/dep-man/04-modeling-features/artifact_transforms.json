        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Registering an artifact transform in Gradle allows you to define how to modify artifacts during the dependency resolution process. This enables Gradle to automatically apply transformations to dependencies to meet specific requirements, such as changing the format or structure of the artifacts."

        "question": "Which of the following is a requirement when registering an artifact transform?",
        "options": {
            "A": "At least one 'from' and one 'to' attribute must be specified",
            "B": "The transform must be registered in a separate Gradle project",
            "C": "The transform must be executed before any tasks are run",
            "D": "The transform must have a corresponding test case defined"
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When registering an artifact transform, it is required to specify at least one 'from' attribute and one 'to' attribute. This establishes the relationship between the input and output formats of the artifacts being transformed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if a requested variant of a dependency already exists in Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Gradle will run the registered artifact transforms anyway",
            "B": "Gradle will skip the artifact transforms and use the existing variant",
            "C": "Gradle will throw an error and stop the build process",
            "D": "Gradle will automatically create a new variant"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If a requested variant of a dependency already exists, Gradle will skip the registered artifact transforms and use the existing variant. This behavior ensures that unnecessary transformations are not performed, optimizing the build process."

    {
        "question": "In which block of a Gradle build script do you typically register an artifact transform?",
        "options": {
            "A": "repositories { }",
            "B": "plugins { }",
            "C": "dependencies { }",
            "D": "tasks { }"
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Artifact transforms are typically registered within the 'dependencies { }' block of a Gradle build script. This is where you define how dependencies are managed and how transforms can be applied to them during resolution."
