            "D": "To create multiple versions of the same library"
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary goal of dependency management is to ensure that all software components are up to date and compatible with each other. This involves tracking and resolving dependencies to avoid conflicts and ensure that the software functions correctly with the required libraries and frameworks."
