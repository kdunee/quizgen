        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of version selection is to determine which version of a module to use based on specified criteria, such as version constraints, status attributes, and compatibility with other dependencies. This process ensures that the most appropriate version is chosen for the project, balancing stability and feature requirements."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which attribute is primarily used to influence version selection in Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "org.gradle.version",
            "B": "org.gradle.status",
            "C": "org.gradle.priority",
            "D": "org.gradle.releaseDate"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The attribute primarily used to influence version selection in Gradle is 'org.gradle.status'. This attribute indicates the maturity level of a module and is considered during the version selection process, allowing Gradle to select the highest version that meets the specified status criteria."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if a module's status is set to 'integration' during version selection?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It will be ignored in favor of stable releases.",
            "B": "It will be selected only if no other versions are available.",
            "C": "It will be prioritized over all other statuses.",
            "D": "It will select the highest version regardless of its maturity."
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If a module's status is set to 'integration', it will typically be ignored in favor of stable releases during version selection. The 'integration' status is considered the least mature, meaning that Gradle will prefer versions with a higher maturity status, such as 'release' or 'milestone', when available."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can a custom status scheme affect version selection?",
        "options": {
            "A": "By allowing any version to be selected regardless of its status.",
            "B": "By changing the order of maturity levels considered during selection.",
            "C": "By enforcing a single version across all dependencies.",
            "D": "By automatically updating all dependencies to their latest versions."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A custom status scheme can affect version selection by changing the order of maturity levels considered during the selection process. This allows developers to define their own levels of maturity and how they should influence which versions are selected, providing more control over dependency management."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of a status scheme in Gradle's component metadata?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To define the maturity levels of a module over time",
            "B": "To specify the dependencies of a module",
            "C": "To determine the file structure of a module",
            "D": "To manage the versioning of a module"
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The status scheme in Gradle's component metadata is used to define the maturity levels of a module over time. It categorizes the module's versions into different statuses, such as 'integration', 'milestone', and 'release', which helps in understanding the stability and readiness of the module for production use."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which attribute is primarily influenced by the status scheme during dependency resolution?",
        "options": {
            "A": "org.gradle.version",
            "B": "org.gradle.status",
            "C": "org.gradle.dependencies",
            "D": "org.gradle.metadata"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The attribute primarily influenced by the status scheme during dependency resolution is 'org.gradle.status'. This attribute determines how Gradle interprets the maturity of a module and affects the selection of versions based on their defined statuses."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Gradle determine the status of a module when using different metadata formats?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It always defaults to 'release' status.",
            "B": "It uses the status defined in the module's metadata.",
            "C": "It ignores the status and selects the latest version.",
            "D": "It assigns a random status to each module."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gradle determines the status of a module based on the status defined in the module's metadata. For example, in Gradle Module Metadata, it uses the published value for the 'org.gradle.status' attribute, while in Ivy metadata, it defaults to 'integration' if no status is defined."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when a custom status scheme is applied to a component in Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It restricts the module to only one version.",
            "B": "It allows for more flexible version selection based on maturity levels.",
            "C": "It prevents any version from being selected.",
            "D": "It automatically updates all dependencies to the latest version."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a custom status scheme is applied to a component in Gradle, it allows for more flexible version selection based on maturity levels. This means that different statuses can be defined, influencing how Gradle selects versions during dependency resolution, particularly when using selectors like 'latest.someStatus'."
