        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of dependency management is to handle the inclusion and versioning of external libraries and their dependencies. This involves resolving conflicts between different versions of libraries, ensuring compatibility, and managing transitive dependencies to maintain a stable and functional software project."

        "question": "What does it mean to 'force' a dependency version in a project?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To automatically update all dependencies to their latest versions",
            "B": "To explicitly declare a specific version of a dependency that must be used, overriding other versions",

        "explanation": "Forcing a dependency version means explicitly declaring a specific version of a dependency that must be used, overriding any other versions that may be present in the dependency graph. This is often done to ensure compatibility with the project's code, especially when newer versions introduce breaking changes."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Excluding a transitive dependency may lead to runtime errors if the excluded dependency is required by the code. This is because the code may rely on functionality provided by the excluded dependency, and without it, the application may fail to run correctly."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The difference between forced dependencies and strict dependencies is that forced dependencies override all other versions found in the dependency graph, while strict dependencies can lead to build failures if there are conflicting versions. Strict dependencies require careful management to avoid resolution errors, especially when different parts of the project depend on different versions."

        "explanation": "Transitive dependencies are those that are not directly declared by a project but are required by the project's direct dependencies. When a library depends on another library, the second library becomes a transitive dependency of the first. Understanding transitive dependencies is crucial for managing the overall dependency graph in a project."
