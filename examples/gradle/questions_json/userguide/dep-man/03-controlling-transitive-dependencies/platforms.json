        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of conflict resolution in dependency management is to determine which version of a dependency to use when multiple versions are requested. This process ensures that the build system can select a compatible version that satisfies all the requirements specified by the various dependencies in the project."

        "question": "Which of the following statements about conflict resolution is true?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Conflict resolution only applies to direct dependencies, not transitive ones.",
            "B": "Conflict resolution can lead to the selection of a version that is not explicitly declared in the project.",
            "C": "Conflict resolution guarantees that the latest version of a dependency will always be used.",
            "D": "Conflict resolution is not necessary if all dependencies are declared in a version catalog."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Conflict resolution can lead to the selection of a version that is not explicitly declared in the project. This occurs when multiple dependencies require different versions of the same library, and the build system must choose a version that satisfies all constraints, which may not be the latest version or the one directly specified."
    },
    {
        "question": "What role do version catalogs play in conflict resolution?",
        "options": {
            "A": "They eliminate the need for conflict resolution entirely.",
            "B": "They provide a centralized way to declare and manage dependency versions.",
            "C": "They automatically resolve conflicts by selecting the highest version available.",
            "D": "They restrict the versions of dependencies that can be used in a project."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Version catalogs provide a centralized way to declare and manage dependency versions, which can help streamline the conflict resolution process. By having a single source of truth for dependency versions, it becomes easier to manage and resolve conflicts that may arise from multiple dependencies requiring different versions."

    {
        "question": "Which of the following is a common strategy for resolving dependency conflicts?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Always using the version specified by the first dependency declared.",
            "B": "Selecting the highest version of the dependency requested by any of the dependencies.",
            "C": "Ignoring all version specifications and using the latest version available.",
            "D": "Automatically downgrading all dependencies to the lowest version available."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A common strategy for resolving dependency conflicts is to select the highest version of the dependency requested by any of the dependencies. This approach aims to ensure that the most recent and potentially most compatible version is used, while still satisfying the requirements of all dependencies involved."
