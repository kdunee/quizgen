        "question": "Which of the following statements is true regarding Gradle API dependencies?",
        "options": {
            "A": "They are only used for managing external libraries.",
            "B": "They are essential for writing and executing functional tests for Gradle plugins.",
            "C": "They can be declared without specifying a version.",
            "D": "They are not compatible with custom Gradle tasks."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gradle API dependencies are essential for writing and executing functional tests for Gradle plugins. They provide the necessary tools and interfaces to interact with Gradle's core functionalities during testing."

    {
        "question": "What is the primary purpose of dependency configurations in Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To declare and manage dependencies for different scopes",
            "B": "To compile source code into executable files",
            "C": "To create user interfaces for applications",
            "D": "To manage version control for source code"
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of dependency configurations in Gradle is to declare and manage dependencies for different scopes, such as compile-time and runtime. This allows developers to specify which dependencies are needed for various tasks and ensures that the correct dependencies are available when required."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the 'canBeResolved' flag indicate about a configuration in Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "The configuration can be used to declare dependencies only.",
            "B": "The configuration can be resolved to compute a dependency graph.",
            "C": "The configuration is deprecated and should not be used.",
            "D": "The configuration is only for consumer purposes."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The 'canBeResolved' flag indicates that a configuration can be resolved to compute a dependency graph. This means that it contains all the necessary information for resolution to happen, allowing Gradle to determine which artifacts to download and use."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of a configuration that has 'canBeConsumed' set to true?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It is meant to declare dependencies for internal use only.",
            "B": "It exposes artifacts and their dependencies for consumption by other projects.",
            "C": "It is used to compile source code into executable files.",
            "D": "It is intended for testing purposes only."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A configuration that has 'canBeConsumed' set to true is designed to expose artifacts and their dependencies for consumption by other projects. This allows other projects to utilize the artifacts produced by the project that defines the configuration."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can configurations in Gradle inherit dependencies?",
        "options": {
            "A": "By using the 'extendsFrom' method to create a hierarchy.",
            "B": "By declaring all dependencies in a single configuration.",
            "C": "By merging all configurations into one.",
            "D": "By defining dependencies in the build script only."
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Configurations in Gradle can inherit dependencies by using the 'extendsFrom' method to create a hierarchy. This allows child configurations to inherit all dependencies declared in their parent configurations, facilitating better organization and reuse of dependencies."
