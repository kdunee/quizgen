            "A": "When you want to ensure all dependencies are strictly enforced.",

        "explanation": "Lenient artifact resolution is typically used in scenarios where some dependencies may not exist or there are unresolved conflicts. This approach allows the build to proceed even in the presence of such issues, making it useful for projects with less stable dependency trees."
