            "D": "To resolve conflicts between different versions of dependencies"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In dependency management, a producer is responsible for generating artifacts that will be consumed by other projects. This involves creating libraries or components that other developers or applications can utilize, distinguishing the producer's role from that of a consumer, which relies on these artifacts."

        "question": "What does strong encapsulation in dependency management ensure?",
        "options": {
            "A": "All dependencies are visible to consumers at all times",
            "B": "Only the public API of a library is exposed to its consumers",

            "D": "Producers must include all dependencies in their public API"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Strong encapsulation ensures that only the public API of a library is visible to its consumers, while implementation dependencies remain hidden. This means that consumers do not need to be aware of the internal workings of a library, which helps maintain a clean separation between the library's interface and its implementation."

        "question": "What is a consequence of adding a dependency to a library project?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It will not affect any consumers of the library",

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a developer adds a dependency to a library project, that dependency becomes a transitive dependency for any consumers of the library. This means that the consumer may also need to manage this dependency, including resolving any version conflicts that arise, which can impact the consumer's project."

        "question": "Why is it important for producers to be respectful of consumers in dependency management?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To ensure that consumers can modify the producer's code",
            "B": "To prevent consumers from experiencing issues due to transitive dependencies",

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Producers must be respectful of consumers because adding dependencies can create transitive dependencies that may lead to conflicts or issues for the consumers. Understanding the implications of these dependencies helps producers make informed decisions that minimize negative impacts on consumers' projects."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Strong encapsulation benefits consumers by ensuring that they only see the public API of a library, rather than all its implementation details. This means that consumers are shielded from changes in the library's internal workings, which can help maintain compatibility and reduce the risk of breaking changes."

        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of producer variants is to generate different artifacts tailored for different types of consumers. This allows a single codebase to produce multiple binaries that can cater to specific needs, such as different versions for Java and Android projects, ensuring that consumers receive the appropriate artifact for their context."
