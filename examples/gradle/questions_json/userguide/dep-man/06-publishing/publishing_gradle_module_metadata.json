        "question": "What does reproducibility of Gradle Module Metadata ensure?",
        "options": {
            "A": "The metadata file is always the same for every build invocation.",
            "B": "The metadata file can change based on the build environment.",
            "C": "The metadata file is generated only when there are changes in the build scripts.",
            "D": "The metadata file is linked to a unique identifier for each build."
        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Reproducibility of Gradle Module Metadata allows users to link a unique identifier to the produced metadata, ensuring that each build invocation generates a distinct metadata file. This helps in tracking and managing different builds effectively, even if the build inputs or scripts remain unchanged."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is the task generating Gradle Module Metadata never marked 'UP-TO-DATE'?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Because it always produces different outputs.",
            "B": "Because it is designed to run every time regardless of changes.",
            "C": "Because it is dependent on external factors.",
            "D": "Because it is implemented in a way that prevents it from being up-to-date."
        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The task generating Gradle Module Metadata is never marked 'UP-TO-DATE' due to its implementation. This means that while the output may remain the same if there are no changes in build inputs or scripts, the task itself is always executed, ensuring that the metadata can be linked to a specific build instance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a potential reason for disabling the publication of Gradle Module Metadata?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To improve the performance of the build process.",
            "B": "To ensure compatibility with Gradle-specific features.",
            "C": "To avoid conflicts with other metadata formats.",
            "D": "To allow for more flexible dependency management."
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Disabling the publication of Gradle Module Metadata may be necessary if the repository being used rejects the metadata file due to it being an unknown format. This ensures that there are no conflicts with other metadata formats like Maven or Ivy, which may not support Gradle-specific concepts."
