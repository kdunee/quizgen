        "question": "How does the presence of an extra numeric part in a version affect its ordering?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It makes the version lower than versions without that part.",

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Special non-numeric parts like 'dev' and 'release' have specific meanings in version ordering. For example, 'dev' is considered lower than any other non-numeric part, while terms like 'release' are considered higher than most other strings. This helps to create a consistent and predictable ordering system for versions."
