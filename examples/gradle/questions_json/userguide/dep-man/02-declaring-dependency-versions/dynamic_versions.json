        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A dynamic version allows for the latest version or a range of versions to be used in dependency management. This flexibility is useful during development or when creating libraries that need to be compatible with various versions of dependencies."

    {
        "question": "What is a potential risk of using dynamic versions in a project?",
        "options": {
            "A": "They always lead to faster build times",
            "B": "They can cause unreproducible builds due to API changes",
            "C": "They ensure that all dependencies are always up to date",
            "D": "They eliminate the need for version control in projects"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using dynamic versions can lead to unreproducible builds because as new versions of a dependency are released, they may introduce incompatible API changes. This can result in the source code failing to compile if it relies on a specific API that has changed."

        "question": "How does Gradle handle caching for dynamic versions by default?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It caches them indefinitely without checking for updates",
            "B": "It caches them for 24 hours before checking for new versions",
            "C": "It does not cache dynamic versions at all",
            "D": "It caches them for 1 hour and then checks for updates"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "By default, Gradle caches dynamic versions for 24 hours. During this time, it does not attempt to resolve newer versions from the declared repositories, which helps to reduce unnecessary network calls and improve build performance."

    {
        "question": "What is a common use case for declaring a dynamic version?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To ensure that a project always uses the same version of a dependency",
            "B": "To integrate the latest features of a dependency during development",

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A common use case for declaring a dynamic version is to integrate the latest features of a dependency during development. This allows developers to take advantage of cutting-edge updates without having to manually change the version number each time a new release occurs."

        "question": "What is a changing version in the context of dependency management?",
        "options": {

            "D": "A version that is only used for testing purposes"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A changing version refers to a version of a module that is still under active development and has not yet been released as a stable version. This means that the features and functionalities may evolve, and the version can change frequently, making it suitable for early integration but potentially unstable."

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In Maven repositories, changing versions are typically denoted with the suffix '-SNAPSHOT'. This indicates that the version is still in development and may change, allowing users to access the latest updates before a stable release is available."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using changing versions can lead to unreproducible builds because the underlying code may change frequently. As new versions are released, they may introduce incompatible API changes, which can cause the project to fail to compile or behave unexpectedly."

        "explanation": "Dynamic versions in dependency management allow developers to use the latest version or a specified range of versions of a dependency. This flexibility is useful during development or when integrating new features, but it can also lead to potential issues with compatibility if the API of the dependency changes."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using dynamic versions can lead to the risk of breaking the build if a new version of a dependency introduces an incompatible API change. This is because the build may automatically resolve to the latest version, which might not be compatible with the existing code."

        "explanation": "The primary goal of achieving reproducible builds is to ensure that builds produce the same output every time they are executed. This consistency is crucial for debugging, collaboration, and maintaining the integrity of software projects, as it allows developers to trust that the build process will yield the same results under the same conditions."

        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using dependency locking can help maintain reproducible builds when using dynamic versions. Dependency locking ensures that specific versions of dependencies are used consistently across builds, preventing unexpected changes that could arise from using the latest versions or dynamic version specifications."

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Controlling dynamic version caching allows developers to manage how often Gradle checks for new versions of dependencies. By adjusting the time-to-live (TTL) threshold, developers can specify whether Gradle should resolve new versions more frequently or maintain the default caching duration."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A changing version indicates that the feature set is still under active development and has not yet been released as a stable version. This allows consumers to integrate unfinished versions of artifacts early and often, which is common in development workflows."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of component selection rules in Gradle is to influence which component instance should be selected when multiple versions are available. These rules allow for explicit rejection of certain versions based on defined conditions, ensuring that only acceptable versions are considered for selection."
