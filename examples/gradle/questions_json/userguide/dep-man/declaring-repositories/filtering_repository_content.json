        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of repository content filtering in Gradle is to declare what a repository may or may not contain. This allows developers to optimize performance, enhance security, and improve reliability by controlling the visibility and accessibility of dependencies within specific repositories."

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using exclusive content filtering in Gradle prevents the same artifact from being found in multiple repositories. This means that if an artifact is declared in one repository as exclusive, it cannot be resolved from any other repository, which can help maintain clarity and control over dependency management."

        "explanation": "Filtering repository content in Gradle primarily benefits performance and security. By specifying what a repository may or may not contain, developers can avoid unnecessary searches for dependencies that won't be found, thus enhancing build performance and preventing sensitive information about dependencies from being exposed."
