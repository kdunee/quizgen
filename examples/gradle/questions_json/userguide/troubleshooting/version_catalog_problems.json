        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of a version catalog in Gradle is to manage and organize dependencies along with their versions. This allows developers to define and reference libraries in a structured way, ensuring consistency and ease of updates across projects."

        "question": "What happens if a version catalog contains too many entries?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It will automatically optimize the entries to fit the limit",
            "B": "An error will occur due to exceeding the maximum entry limit",

            "D": "Gradle will merge the entries into a single entry"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If a version catalog contains too many entries, an error will occur because Gradle imposes a limit on the number of aliases that can be included in a single catalog. This limit is currently set at 32,000 entries, and exceeding this limit requires splitting the catalog into multiple distinct catalogs."
    },

        "question": "What should you do if you encounter an 'undefined version reference' error in a version catalog?",
        "options": {

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If you encounter an 'undefined version reference' error, you should ensure that the version reference points to an existing version alias declared in the catalog. This error indicates that the catalog is trying to reference a version that has not been defined, which can be resolved by correcting the reference or declaring the missing version."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using reserved alias names in a version catalog can lead to an error due to a naming conflict with generated accessors. Reserved names typically include those that start with 'versions', 'bundles', or 'plugins', and using them can cause issues in the catalog's functionality."

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'undefined version reference' error indicates that a library in the version catalog is trying to reference a version that has not been defined. This means that the version reference must either be corrected to point to an existing version or a new version must be declared in the catalog."

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The 'alias not finished' error message indicates that an alias builder was created but not properly registered with the catalog. This typically happens when the necessary method to finalize the alias, such as calling '.version()' or '.withoutVersion()', has not been executed."
