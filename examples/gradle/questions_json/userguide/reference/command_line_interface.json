        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of task dependencies in Gradle is to define the order in which tasks are executed. When a task depends on another, Gradle ensures that the dependent task is completed before executing the task that relies on it.

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Gradle respects task dependencies when executing multiple tasks. It ensures that tasks are executed in the correct order based on their dependencies, meaning that if a task depends on another, the dependent task will be executed first. This guarantees that all prerequisites are satisfied before a task runs, maintaining the integrity of the build process."

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If a task with dependencies is executed without its prerequisites being completed, the task will fail to execute. Gradle enforces the execution order based on task dependencies, and if a required task has not been completed, the dependent task cannot run. This mechanism helps prevent errors and ensures that all necessary conditions are met before a task is executed."

        "question": "What is the primary purpose of dependency management in Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To automate the build process without user intervention",
            "B": "To handle the inclusion and resolution of external libraries and modules",

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of dependency management in Gradle is to handle the inclusion and resolution of external libraries and modules. This involves specifying dependencies in the build script, allowing Gradle to automatically download and manage the versions of these libraries, ensuring that the project has the necessary components to compile and run correctly."

    {
        "question": "How does Gradle ensure that the correct versions of dependencies are used?",
        "options": {
            "A": "By allowing users to manually download and install dependencies",
            "B": "By using a centralized repository that hosts all available versions",
            "C": "By automatically updating all dependencies to the latest version",
            "D": "By requiring all dependencies to be specified in the build script"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gradle ensures that the correct versions of dependencies are used by utilizing a centralized repository that hosts all available versions. When a dependency is specified in the build script, Gradle checks this repository to find the appropriate version, resolving any conflicts and ensuring compatibility with other dependencies."

        "question": "What command can be used to list the dependencies of a project in Gradle?",
        "options": {

            "D": "gradle dependency-report"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The command 'gradle dependencies' is used to list the dependencies of a project in Gradle. This command provides a detailed report of the project's dependencies, including direct and transitive dependencies, which helps in understanding the project's structure and resolving any potential issues."

    {
        "question": "What is a common consequence of not managing dependencies properly in a Gradle project?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Increased build speed",
            "B": "Conflicts between different versions of libraries",
            "C": "Automatic updates of all project files",
            "D": "Simplified project structure"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A common consequence of not managing dependencies properly in a Gradle project is conflicts between different versions of libraries. If multiple dependencies require different versions of the same library, it can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior, making it crucial to manage and resolve these dependencies effectively."
