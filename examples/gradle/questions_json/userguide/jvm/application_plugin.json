        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of the Application extension in Gradle is to configure the behavior of the application plugin. This extension allows developers to specify various properties and settings that affect how the application is built and run, ensuring that the application meets specific requirements."

        "question": "How can developers customize the Application extension in their build script?",
        "options": {
            "A": "By using the `application {}` block",
            "B": "By modifying the `settings.gradle` file",

        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Developers can customize the Application extension in their build script by using the `application {}` block. This block allows them to set various properties related to the application, such as the main class, executable directory, and default JVM arguments, thereby tailoring the build process to their needs."

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The Application extension provides application-specific settings for configuration. These settings allow developers to define how the application should behave during the build and execution phases, including specifying the main class and other relevant parameters that are crucial for the application's operation."

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Managing user authentication is not a feature of the Application extension. The Application extension focuses on configuring aspects related to building and running JVM applications, such as specifying the main class, setting default JVM arguments, and customizing the directory for start scripts, but it does not handle user authentication."
