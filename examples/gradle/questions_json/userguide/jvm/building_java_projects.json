            "A": "Automatic compilation of source code",
            "B": "Support for multiple programming languages",
            "C": "Test filtering and selection",
            "D": "Dependency management"
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A common feature provided by testing frameworks is test filtering and selection, which allows developers to specify which tests to run based on various criteria, such as tags or test names. This feature helps in running specific tests during development or continuous integration processes."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `test` task in a Java project using a testing framework?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To compile the test source code",
            "B": "To run the tests defined in the project",
            "C": "To package the application into a JAR file",
            "D": "To manage project dependencies"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The role of the `test` task in a Java project using a testing framework is to run the tests defined in the project. This task automatically discovers and executes the tests, providing feedback on their success or failure, which is crucial for ensuring the reliability of the code."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is it important to have a testing framework integrated into a Java project?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To ensure that the project can be built successfully",
            "B": "To facilitate the management of external libraries",
            "C": "To improve code quality and catch bugs early",
            "D": "To automate the deployment process"
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Having a testing framework integrated into a Java project is important to improve code quality and catch bugs early. By running tests regularly, developers can identify issues before they reach production, leading to more stable and reliable software."

    {
        "question": "What is the primary purpose of cross-compilation in Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To compile code for different Java versions or platforms",
            "B": "To run tests on multiple environments simultaneously",
            "C": "To package applications into executable JAR files",
            "D": "To manage dependencies across different projects"
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of cross-compilation in Gradle is to compile code for different Java versions or platforms. This allows developers to ensure that their code is compatible with various environments, which is essential for maintaining software that runs on different systems or Java versions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Gradle feature is recommended for targeting a specific Java version during compilation?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Source compatibility settings",
            "B": "Java toolchains",
            "C": "Dependency configurations",
            "D": "Custom source sets"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Java toolchains are the recommended feature in Gradle for targeting a specific Java version during compilation. Toolchains provide a consistent way to manage the Java version used for compiling, executing, and generating documentation, ensuring that the correct version is utilized across different tasks."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a potential risk of using the `sourceCompatibility` and `targetCompatibility` properties for cross-compilation?",
        "options": {
            "A": "They can lead to runtime failures due to weaker guarantees.",
            "B": "They require additional configuration for each source set.",
            "C": "They automatically manage dependencies for different versions.",
            "D": "They are deprecated and not supported in newer Gradle versions."
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Using the `sourceCompatibility` and `targetCompatibility` properties for cross-compilation can lead to runtime failures due to weaker guarantees. These properties do not protect against the use of APIs introduced in later Java versions, which can result in compatibility issues when the code is executed on different JVMs."
    },
    {
        "question": "When should a developer consider using custom source sets in a Gradle project?",
        "options": {
            "A": "When the project has multiple types of tests that require different configurations.",
            "B": "When the project only has a single source directory.",
            "C": "When the project does not use any external libraries.",
            "D": "When the project is small and does not require complex builds."
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A developer should consider using custom source sets in a Gradle project when the project has multiple types of tests that require different configurations. Custom source sets allow for better organization and management of different source files, especially when they have unique dependencies or compilation requirements."
