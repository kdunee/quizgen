            "D": "To compile source code into bytecode"
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of Gradle plugins is to enhance the functionality of Gradle builds by providing additional tasks, configurations, and capabilities that can be applied to projects. This allows developers to customize their build processes and integrate various tools and frameworks."

        "question": "Which of the following statements is true regarding the Test Report Aggregation plugin?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It can be used independently without any other plugins.",
            "B": "It requires the JVM Test Suite Plugin to function properly.",
            "C": "It automatically generates reports without any configuration.",
            "D": "It is only applicable to Java applications."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Test Report Aggregation plugin requires the JVM Test Suite Plugin to function properly. It is designed to aggregate test results from multiple test task invocations across Gradle projects, but it does not take action unless it is applied in conjunction with the JVM Test Suite Plugin."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of the `testReportAggregation` configuration in the Test Report Aggregation plugin?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To define the output format of the test reports",
            "B": "To declare project dependencies that have test result data to be aggregated",
            "C": "To specify the location of the test source files",
            "D": "To manage the execution order of test tasks"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The `testReportAggregation` configuration is used to declare all project dependencies that have test result data to be aggregated. This allows the plugin to collect and compile test results from various sources into a single report, facilitating better analysis of test outcomes."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "By default, Gradle stops executing tasks when any task fails, including test failures. This behavior ensures that subsequent tasks do not run if a critical failure occurs, which helps maintain the integrity of the build process. However, developers can use the `--continue` option to allow the build to proceed despite failures."
