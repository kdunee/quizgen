        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The default behavior of JUnit when a test fails is to log the failure and continue with the next test. This allows for multiple tests to be executed in a single run, providing a comprehensive overview of the test results."

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A common step in setting up integration tests in a Gradle project is creating a new source set specifically for integration tests. This allows for separate configurations and dependencies that are tailored for integration testing, distinct from unit tests."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a key difference between unit tests and integration tests?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Unit tests focus on the interactions between components, while integration tests focus on individual components.",
            "B": "Unit tests are typically faster and run in isolation, while integration tests may involve multiple components and are slower.",
