        "explanation": "The Gradle Daemon can be stopped manually to refresh build configurations. This is useful when changes are made to the build setup that require the Daemon to restart in order to apply those changes effectively."

        "question": "What is the purpose of task-specific toolchains in Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To define a single toolchain for all tasks in a project",
            "B": "To allow different tasks to use different toolchains based on their requirements",
            "C": "To automatically detect the best toolchain for the entire project",
            "D": "To restrict the use of toolchains to only the compilation tasks"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Task-specific toolchains in Gradle allow different tasks to utilize different toolchains based on their specific requirements. This flexibility is essential for projects that may need to compile, test, or execute code with varying Java versions or configurations, ensuring that each task operates with the most suitable environment."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can a specific task in Gradle be configured to use a different toolchain?",
        "options": {
            "A": "By setting the toolchain in the project-level configuration only",
            "B": "By specifying the toolchain directly in the task configuration",
            "C": "By using the same toolchain for all tasks in the project",
            "D": "By relying on Gradle's auto-detection feature exclusively"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A specific task in Gradle can be configured to use a different toolchain by specifying the toolchain directly in the task configuration. This allows for precise control over which toolchain is used for that particular task, accommodating unique requirements that may differ from the rest of the project."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if a task is configured with a toolchain that is not valid?",
        "options": {
            "A": "The task will run using the default toolchain",
            "B": "Gradle will throw a build error",
            "C": "The task will skip execution without any warnings",
            "D": "Gradle will automatically download a new toolchain"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If a task is configured with a toolchain that is not valid, Gradle will throw a build error. This is to ensure that all tasks are executed with a valid and compatible toolchain, maintaining the integrity of the build process."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which of the following is a benefit of using task-specific toolchains?",
        "options": {
            "A": "They simplify the configuration by using a single toolchain for all tasks",
            "B": "They enhance build reproducibility by allowing different environments for different tasks",
            "C": "They eliminate the need for any toolchain configuration",
            "D": "They restrict the use of toolchains to only the main application task"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using task-specific toolchains enhances build reproducibility by allowing different tasks to operate in their own environments tailored to their specific needs. This flexibility is crucial for managing complex projects that may require various Java versions or configurations for different tasks."
