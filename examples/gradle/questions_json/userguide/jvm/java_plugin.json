        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary benefit of incremental compilation in Gradle is that it allows for faster builds by recompiling only the classes that are affected by changes. This means that if a class is modified, only that class and any classes that depend on it will be recompiled, rather than recompiling the entire project."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which of the following statements about incremental compilation is true?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Incremental compilation is always faster than full recompilation.",
            "B": "Incremental compilation can be affected by changes to source-retention annotations.",
            "C": "Incremental compilation does not consider class dependencies.",
            "D": "Incremental compilation requires all classes to be in the same project."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Incremental compilation can be affected by changes to source-retention annotations because these annotations are not visible in bytecode. If a source-retention annotation is changed, it will trigger a full recompilation of the affected classes, as the compiler cannot determine the impact of the change on the bytecode."

        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A class is considered 'affected' in incremental compilation if it has been changed or if it depends on another affected class. This dependency analysis allows Gradle to determine which classes need recompilation, optimizing the build process."

        "question": "How does Gradle improve incremental compilation performance?",
        "options": {
            "A": "By recompiling all classes every time.",

            "D": "By using a single source directory for all classes."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gradle improves incremental compilation performance by applying good software design principles like loose coupling. For instance, using interfaces between classes can minimize recompilation, as dependent classes are only recompiled when the interface changes, rather than when the implementation changes."

            "D": "Processors that are only used during runtime"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "'Isolating' annotation processors operate on each annotated element independently, creating generated files or validation messages for each element. This allows for efficient processing as changes to one element do not affect others, leading to faster compilation times."

        "question": "What happens when a resource file is changed in a project using annotation processing?",
        "options": {

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a resource file is changed, Gradle triggers a full recompilation of the project. This is because resource files are often integral to the functioning of the code, and changes to them can affect the overall behavior of the application."
