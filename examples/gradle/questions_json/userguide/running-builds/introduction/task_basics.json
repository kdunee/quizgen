        "question": "What is a task in the context of Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "A unit of work that a build performs",
            "B": "A configuration file for project settings",
            "C": "A type of plugin used in Gradle",
            "D": "A command to install dependencies"
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In Gradle, a task represents an independent unit of work that the build system performs, such as compiling code or generating documentation. Tasks are fundamental to the build process, allowing for modular and organized execution of various operations."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you view all available tasks in a Gradle project?",
        "options": {
            "A": "By running the command `./gradlew list`",
            "B": "By running the command `./gradlew tasks`",
            "C": "By checking the build.gradle file",
            "D": "By executing the command `./gradlew help`"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To view all available tasks in a Gradle project, you can run the command `./gradlew tasks`. This command lists all tasks defined in the project, including those provided by plugins and build scripts, helping users understand what operations can be performed."

    {
        "question": "What does it mean when a task has dependencies in Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It can run independently without any prerequisites",
            "B": "It requires other tasks to be completed first",
            "C": "It is automatically executed after all tasks",
            "D": "It cannot be executed if other tasks fail"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a task has dependencies in Gradle, it means that it requires other tasks to be completed before it can run. For example, the `build` task depends on the `compileJava` task, meaning that the Java code must be compiled before the build process can proceed."

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a task has dependencies in Gradle, it means that the task must complete before another task can start. This ensures that tasks are executed in the correct order, allowing for proper build execution and resource management."

            "D": "It means the task can only be executed manually by the user."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In Gradle, a task dependency means that one task must complete before another task can start. This ensures that tasks are executed in the correct order, particularly when one task relies on the output or completion of another task."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Gradle determine the order of task execution?",
        "options": {

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Gradle determines the order of task execution by analyzing the defined task dependencies. When a task depends on another, Gradle ensures that the dependent task is executed first, maintaining the correct sequence for successful builds."

    {
        "question": "What is the primary purpose of Gradle plugins?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To define the structure of a project",
