    {
        "question": "How does Gradle determine whether to execute a task during an incremental build?",
        "options": {
            "A": "By checking if the task has been manually marked for execution",
            "B": "By comparing the current build time with the previous build time",

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Gradle determines whether to execute a task during an incremental build by evaluating if the inputs or outputs of the task have changed. If there are no changes, the task is skipped, which enhances build efficiency."

        "question": "What indication does Gradle provide when a task has not changed and is skipped during an incremental build?",

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a task has not changed and is skipped during an incremental build, Gradle indicates this by marking the task as 'UP-TO-DATE'. This label signifies that the task's inputs and outputs remain unchanged since the last execution."

        "question": "Which of the following statements about incremental builds is true?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Incremental builds are optional and can be disabled by the user.",
            "B": "Incremental builds require tasks to define their inputs and outputs.",

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Incremental builds require tasks to define their inputs and outputs to function correctly. This definition allows Gradle to assess whether changes have occurred and decide whether to execute the task or skip it, thus optimizing the build process."

        "question": "What is the primary purpose of build caching in Gradle?",
        "options": {

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a task has been executed from the build cache, Gradle marks it as 'FROM-CACHE'. This indicates that the task's output was retrieved from the cache rather than being rebuilt, which helps to optimize build times by reusing previously computed results."
