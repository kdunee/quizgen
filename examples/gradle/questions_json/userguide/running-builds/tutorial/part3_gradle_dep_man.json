        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A version catalog in Gradle is used to declare all direct dependencies of a project in a central location, allowing for easier management and updates of those dependencies across subprojects. This centralization helps maintain consistency and simplifies dependency management."

        "question": "What is a transitive dependency?",
        "options": {
            "A": "A dependency that is declared directly in the build file",

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A transitive dependency is a dependency that is required by another dependency. For example, if a library depends on another library, the latter is considered a transitive dependency of the project that uses the first library."

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You can view the dependency tree of a Gradle project by running the command `./gradlew :app:dependencies`. This command provides a detailed output of all dependencies, including transitive dependencies, allowing developers to understand the structure of their project's dependencies."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A transitive dependency is a dependency that is required by another dependency. In Gradle, when a library depends on another library, the latter becomes a transitive dependency of the project. This allows for automatic inclusion of necessary libraries without needing to declare them explicitly."

        "question": "Why is it important to understand transitive dependencies when managing project dependencies?",
        "options": {
            "A": "They can increase the size of the project without any benefits.",
            "B": "They can lead to version conflicts if not managed properly.",

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Understanding transitive dependencies is crucial because they can lead to version conflicts if different libraries require different versions of the same transitive dependency. Proper management ensures that the project remains stable and functions correctly with all required libraries."

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "You can view the transitive dependencies of a project in Gradle by running the command `./gradlew :app:dependencies`. This command outputs the dependency tree, showing both direct and transitive dependencies, which helps in understanding the complete set of libraries used in the project."

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A local repository is an example of a repository type in Gradle. It can store dependencies that are available on the local file system, while other types of repositories, such as remote repositories, can be accessed over the internet to fetch dependencies."
