        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of incremental builds in Gradle is to avoid running tasks whose inputs have not changed since the last build. This optimization helps to save time and resources by skipping unnecessary task executions, allowing for faster build processes."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To enable verbose output in Gradle, you add the line org.gradle.console=verbose to the gradle.properties file. This setting instructs Gradle to provide more detailed output during the build process, which can help in debugging and understanding the build flow."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In an incremental build, if the inputs and outputs of tasks have not changed since the last build, Gradle skips executing those tasks. This optimization reduces build time by avoiding unnecessary work, allowing developers to focus on changes that matter."
