        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "It is true that tasks can modify their own inputs during execution. This behavior can lead to build cycles if a task continuously modifies its inputs, prompting Gradle to re-execute the task. Understanding this aspect is crucial for managing task dependencies and avoiding unintended build loops."
