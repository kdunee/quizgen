        "explanation": "The primary purpose of configuration avoidance in Gradle is to delay or completely avoid configuring tasks that will not be executed in a build. This helps improve build performance by preventing unnecessary configuration overhead, especially for tasks that are not relevant to the current build execution."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Kotlin DSL supports configuration avoidance by providing type-safe model accessors that leverage the new APIs introduced in Gradle. This allows for more efficient task configuration, as it can defer the configuration of tasks until they are actually needed."

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If a plugin is applied using the imperative `apply()` function, it must be configured using the `configure<T>()` function to access its configuration options. This is necessary because the type-safe accessors are not available when using the imperative syntax."
