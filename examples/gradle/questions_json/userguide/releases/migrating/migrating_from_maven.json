        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of configuration management in build tools is to manage the versions of dependencies and ensure consistency across builds. This involves specifying which versions of libraries and frameworks are used, thereby preventing issues that arise from version conflicts and ensuring that the build behaves consistently across different environments."

        "question": "How does Gradle's approach to dependency management differ from Maven's?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Gradle allows for more flexible dependency version resolution, picking the newest version by default",
            "B": "Gradle does not support transitive dependencies",
            "C": "Maven allows for more control over dependency versions than Gradle",
            "D": "Gradle requires all dependencies to be declared in a single file"
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Gradle's approach to dependency management is more flexible than Maven's, as it picks the newest version of a dependency by default when multiple versions are present. This contrasts with Maven's 'closest' match algorithm, which can lead to different versions being resolved based on the dependency tree structure."

        "question": "What is a key benefit of using a build tool like Gradle for configuration management?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It eliminates the need for any manual configuration",
            "B": "It provides a clear and consistent way to manage project dependencies and build processes",
            "C": "It automatically generates user documentation for the project",
            "D": "It ensures that all code is written in a single programming language"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A key benefit of using a build tool like Gradle for configuration management is that it provides a clear and consistent way to manage project dependencies and build processes. This helps developers maintain control over their builds, ensuring that all necessary components are included and correctly configured, which ultimately leads to more reliable and reproducible builds."

        "question": "In Gradle, what is the purpose of declaring repositories?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To specify where to find the source code for the project",
            "B": "To define the locations from which dependencies can be retrieved",
            "C": "To manage the user permissions for the build process",
            "D": "To configure the output directory for build artifacts"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In Gradle, declaring repositories serves the purpose of defining the locations from which dependencies can be retrieved. This is essential for ensuring that the build tool knows where to look for the libraries and frameworks that the project depends on, allowing for successful resolution and inclusion of these dependencies in the build process."
