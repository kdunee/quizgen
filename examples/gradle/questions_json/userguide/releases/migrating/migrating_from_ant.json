        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of artifact publishing in Gradle is to distribute compiled binaries and other artifacts to repositories. This allows developers to share their builds with others, making it easier to manage dependencies and ensure that the correct versions of libraries are used in different projects."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The Ivy Publish Plugin is typically applied to enable artifact publishing to Ivy-compatible repositories. This plugin provides the necessary tasks and configurations to publish artifacts, such as JAR files, to specified repositories, facilitating the distribution of built components."

        "question": "What is a key difference between Ivy's and Gradle's approach to dependency resolution?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Gradle requires manual configuration for dependency resolution.",
            "B": "Ivy automatically resolves dependencies at the beginning of the build.",
            "C": "Gradle does not automatically copy files from the dependency cache.",
            "D": "Ivy does not support dynamic versioning of dependencies."
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A key difference between Ivy's and Gradle's approach to dependency resolution is that Gradle does not automatically copy files from the dependency cache. Instead, Gradle typically uses the files directly in the cache for classpaths and assembling application packages, whereas Ivy's process includes a retrieval step that copies dependencies to a specified directory."

        "question": "What must be configured in Gradle to publish artifacts to a repository?",
        "options": {
            "A": "A build script with Ant tasks",
            "B": "A publication representing the artifacts to be published",
            "C": "A settings file for multi-project builds",
            "D": "A dependency configuration for each artifact"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In Gradle, to publish artifacts to a repository, you must configure a publication that represents the artifacts to be published. This publication includes details about what will be published, such as the artifact files and any additional metadata, allowing Gradle to generate the necessary descriptors and perform the publishing process."
