        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of the feature lifecycle in Gradle is to ensure that features are developed and released in a timely manner. This allows new functionality to be made available to users early, while also incorporating user feedback into the development process, which is a core value of the Gradle platform."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A feature in the 'incubating' state is designed to allow real-world feedback to be incorporated before it is made public. This state provides early access to users who are willing to test potential future changes, helping to refine the feature based on actual usage."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Internal features in Gradle are specifically designed for Gradle's internal use only. They are not intended for public use, are not documented, and can change at any time without prior notice. This means users should avoid relying on these features as they may evolve unpredictably."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Users should avoid using internal features because they can change at any time without notice, which can lead to instability in projects that rely on them. Internal features are not designed for public use and lack documentation, making them unpredictable."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Once a public feature is deprecated, it may still be used, but it is indicated that it will eventually be removed in a future release. The deprecation serves as a warning to users to transition to alternative features or methods, as deprecated features may become stale until their removal."
