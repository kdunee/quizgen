        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gradle 5.0 requires Java 8 or higher to run, which is a significant change from Gradle 4.x that required Java 7. This change ensures compatibility with modern Java features and libraries."

        "question": "What should users do to identify potential issues before upgrading to Gradle 5.0?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Run `gradle help --scan` to view deprecation warnings",
            "B": "Ignore all warnings as they are not relevant",
            "C": "Upgrade directly without checking for issues",
            "D": "Downgrade to Gradle 3.x before upgrading"
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Running `gradle help --scan` allows users to view deprecation warnings and identify potential issues in their builds before upgrading to Gradle 5.0. This proactive approach helps in troubleshooting and ensuring a smooth transition."

    {
        "question": "What is one of the breaking changes introduced in Gradle 5.0?",
        "options": {
            "A": "The `enableFeaturePreview` flags are now mandatory",
            "B": "The separation of compile and runtime dependencies when consuming POMs",
            "C": "All plugins are now deprecated",
            "D": "Gradle no longer supports any plugins"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "One of the breaking changes in Gradle 5.0 is the separation of compile and runtime dependencies when consuming POMs. This change improves the efficiency of the compilation process by ensuring that only necessary dependencies are included in the compilation classpath."

    {
        "question": "What is a primary goal of performance optimization in software builds?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To reduce the time taken for builds to complete",
            "B": "To increase the complexity of the build scripts",
            "C": "To ensure all tasks run in parallel regardless of dependencies",
            "D": "To eliminate the need for version control"
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The primary goal of performance optimization in software builds is to reduce the time taken for builds to complete. This can be achieved through various strategies, such as minimizing unnecessary tasks, optimizing task execution order, and leveraging caching mechanisms."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which of the following is a recommended practice for optimizing build performance?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Always run all tasks in a single thread",
            "B": "Use lazy task configuration to avoid unnecessary task execution",
            "C": "Avoid using any caching mechanisms",
            "D": "Increase the number of tasks to run simultaneously without consideration"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using lazy task configuration is a recommended practice for optimizing build performance. This approach allows Gradle to only configure tasks that are necessary for the current build, thereby reducing the overhead associated with configuring tasks that may not be executed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the benefit of separating compile and runtime dependencies in a build?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It simplifies the build script by reducing the number of dependencies",
            "B": "It speeds up the compilation process by reducing the size of the compilation classpath",
            "C": "It allows for more complex dependency management",
            "D": "It eliminates the need for versioning dependencies"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Separating compile and runtime dependencies benefits the build by speeding up the compilation process. This is achieved by ensuring that only the necessary compile-scoped dependencies are included in the compilation classpath, which reduces its size and improves build performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can using the Gradle daemon improve build performance?",
        "options": {
            "A": "By running builds in a completely isolated environment",
            "B": "By keeping the JVM warm and reducing startup time for builds",
            "C": "By allowing builds to run without any configuration",
            "D": "By automatically optimizing all tasks without user intervention"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using the Gradle daemon can improve build performance by keeping the JVM warm, which reduces the startup time for builds. This means that subsequent builds can start faster since the JVM does not need to be initialized from scratch each time."
