        "explanation": "A key feature of source set management is the separation of source files into distinct sets. This allows developers to manage different types of code, such as production code and test code, in a structured manner, facilitating better organization and clarity in the project."

        "question": "What happens when a source set is configured in Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It automatically generates build tasks for each source file.",
            "B": "It defines the directories where source files are located.",
            "C": "It compiles all source files into a single output file.",
            "D": "It creates a backup of the source files."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a source set is configured in Gradle, it defines the directories where source files are located. This configuration helps Gradle understand where to find the source files for compilation and other tasks, ensuring that the build process can locate and use the correct files."

    {
        "question": "In Gradle, what is the significance of the 'main' source set?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It is used exclusively for test files.",
            "B": "It contains the primary application code.",
            "C": "It is a deprecated feature.",
            "D": "It manages external dependencies."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The 'main' source set in Gradle is significant because it contains the primary application code. This source set is where the main logic of the application resides, and it is typically compiled and packaged as part of the build process."

    {
        "question": "What is the primary purpose of artifact transformations in Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To modify the output of tasks based on input files",
            "B": "To convert artifacts from one format to another",
            "C": "To manage dependencies between projects",
            "D": "To optimize build performance by caching results"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of artifact transformations in Gradle is to convert artifacts from one format to another. This process allows developers to define how input artifacts are transformed into output artifacts, enabling flexibility in handling different types of files and formats within a build."

    {
        "question": "Which of the following statements is true regarding the use of the `ArtifactTransform` class in Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It is the recommended way to implement artifact transformations in Gradle.",
            "B": "It has been deprecated in favor of using the `TransformAction` interface.",
            "C": "It allows for the direct manipulation of project dependencies.",
            "D": "It is used to define the build lifecycle of a Gradle project."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The `ArtifactTransform` class has been deprecated in Gradle in favor of the `TransformAction` interface. This change was made to address various shortcomings and to provide a more robust way to implement artifact transformations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What must be done to register a new artifact transformation in Gradle?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Use the `registerTransform` method with the `ArtifactTransform` class.",
            "B": "Implement the `TransformAction` interface and register it using the `registerTransform` method.",
            "C": "Define the transformation in the build script without any specific method.",
            "D": "Use the `apply` method to include a transformation plugin."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To register a new artifact transformation in Gradle, you must implement the `TransformAction` interface and then register it using the `registerTransform` method. This approach allows for a more structured and efficient way to handle artifact transformations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a key benefit of using artifact transformations in a Gradle build?",
        "options": {
            "A": "They automatically resolve all project dependencies.",
            "B": "They allow for the customization of how artifacts are processed and generated.",
            "C": "They eliminate the need for version control in projects.",
            "D": "They simplify the configuration of build scripts."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A key benefit of using artifact transformations in a Gradle build is that they allow for the customization of how artifacts are processed and generated. This flexibility enables developers to tailor the build process to meet specific requirements and handle various file formats effectively."
