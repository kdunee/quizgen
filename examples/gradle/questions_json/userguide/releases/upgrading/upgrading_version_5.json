        "question": "Which type of build cache is required for local builds in Gradle 6.0?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Custom build cache implementations",
            "B": "Directory build cache",
            "C": "Remote build cache",
            "D": "In-memory build cache"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In Gradle 6.0, the local build cache must always be a Directory build cache. This change ensures consistency and reliability in how local build caches are managed, as opposed to allowing any custom implementations."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if Gradle encounters a problem while packing cached results in the build cache?",
        "options": {
            "A": "The build will continue without any issues.",
            "B": "Gradle will ignore the problem and proceed with the build.",
            "C": "The build will fail, making the problem visible.",
            "D": "Gradle will automatically retry the packing operation."
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In Gradle 6.0, if there is a problem while packing cached results, the build will fail. This change is intended to surface issues that may have previously been hidden, allowing developers to address problems more effectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a significant change regarding the handling of symbolic links in Gradle's build cache?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Symbolic links are now followed during clean operations.",
            "B": "Symbolic links are ignored completely.",
            "C": "Symbolic links are treated as regular files.",
            "D": "Symbolic links are deleted without affecting their contents."
        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "In Gradle 6.0, when Gradle needs to remove output files of a task, it will not follow symbolic links. Instead, the symlink itself will be deleted, but the contents of the linked directory will remain intact. This change ensures that the integrity of the linked content is preserved."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a key change in the Kotlin DSL for Gradle 6.0 regarding script compilation?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Kotlin DSL scripts now extend core Gradle interfaces.",
            "B": "Kotlin DSL scripts are compiled to classes implementing the KotlinScript interface.",
            "C": "Kotlin DSL scripts require explicit type declarations for all variables.",
            "D": "Kotlin DSL scripts can no longer use Gradle APIs."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In Gradle 6.0, Kotlin DSL scripts are compiled to classes that implement the newly introduced KotlinScript interface. This change allows the model objects to be available as implicit receivers in the body of the scripts, enhancing the usability of the DSL."
    },
    {
        "question": "How has the visibility of classes from the buildSrc project changed in Gradle 6.0?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Classes from buildSrc are now visible to settings scripts.",
            "B": "Classes from buildSrc are no longer visible to project build scripts.",
            "C": "Classes from buildSrc are visible to both settings scripts and project build scripts.",
            "D": "Classes from buildSrc are only visible to the buildSrc settings script."
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In Gradle 6.0, classes from the buildSrc project are visible to project build scripts and script plugins, but they are no longer visible to settings scripts. This change allows for better encapsulation while still providing access where needed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a new requirement when using the embedded-kotlin plugin in Gradle 6.0?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It must be applied without any repositories.",
            "B": "A repository must be declared for Kotlin dependencies.",
            "C": "It can only be used with Java projects.",
            "D": "It requires a specific version of the Kotlin compiler."
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "With Gradle 6.0, when using the embedded-kotlin plugin, it is now required to declare a repository where Kotlin dependencies can be found. This ensures that the necessary dependencies are available for the Kotlin DSL to function correctly."
    },
    {
        "question": "What change was made to the `pluginManagement` block in settings scripts in Gradle 6.0?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It can now reference variables declared outside the block.",
            "B": "It is executed during the normal execution of the settings script.",
            "C": "It is executed earlier and cannot reference anything declared elsewhere in the script.",
            "D": "It has been removed entirely from settings scripts."
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In Gradle 6.0, the `pluginManagement` block in settings scripts is executed earlier, similar to `buildscript` or `plugins`. This means that code inside such a block cannot reference anything declared elsewhere in the script, ensuring that plugin management is isolated and predictable."
