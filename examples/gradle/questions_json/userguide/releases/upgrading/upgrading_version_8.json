        "explanation": "The primary purpose of versioning in build tools is to ensure compatibility and stability of software dependencies. By managing versions, developers can avoid conflicts and ensure that the correct versions of libraries and tools are used, which helps maintain the integrity of the build process."

        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "It is important to update plugins when upgrading build tools because plugins may rely on deprecated APIs that could break the build. Keeping plugins updated ensures that they are compatible with the latest version of the build tool and can function correctly without causing issues."
