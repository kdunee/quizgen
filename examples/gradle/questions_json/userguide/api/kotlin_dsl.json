        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "One of the limitations of using Kotlin DSL with Groovy DSL in a Gradle build is that Kotlin DSL is known to be slower than Groovy DSL on first use, particularly in clean checkouts or on ephemeral continuous integration agents. This is due to the slower script compilation process for Kotlin DSL."
