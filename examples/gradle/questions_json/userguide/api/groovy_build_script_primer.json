        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The primary purpose of a Groovy build script is to set properties, configure dependencies, and declare tasks for a project. It serves as a configuration file that utilizes Groovy language constructs to interact with Gradle's API, enabling efficient project management and build processes."

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The presence of an '=' sign in a Groovy build script typically indicates that a property is being set to a new value. This is a common way to define or modify the state of an object within the script, reflecting the configuration aspect of build scripts."

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A key characteristic of methods in Groovy build scripts is that they represent behaviors of objects and can also configure their state. Methods can accept arguments and may or may not require parentheses, depending on the context, but their primary role is to define actions that can be performed on objects."

    {
        "question": "What is the role of blocks in Groovy build scripts?",
        "options": {

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The role of blocks in Groovy build scripts is to configure multiple aspects of a build element in a structured way. Blocks allow for nested configuration and provide a mechanism to group related settings, making the build script more organized and easier to read."

        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A property in a Groovy build script can be identified by the presence of an equals sign (`=`) when setting its value. Properties represent the state of an object and can be accessed or modified directly, distinguishing them from methods, which require parentheses."

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Unqualified names in a Groovy build script typically refer to properties or methods of the implicit `Project` object. This means that if a name is used without qualification, it is often associated with the `Project` API, allowing for easier configuration and access to project-related settings."

        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In Groovy, properties are implemented as methods behind the scenes. Specifically, a property can be read if there is a corresponding getter method and modified if there is a corresponding setter method. This allows properties to function similarly to methods while providing a more concise syntax for accessing and modifying values."
