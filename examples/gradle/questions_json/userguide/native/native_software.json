        "question": "How does Gradle determine the source files included in a source set?",
        "options": {
            "A": "By scanning all directories in the project for any file types",
            "B": "By using predefined directory structures based on the component name and language",
            "C": "By requiring explicit declarations of each file in the build script",
            "D": "By automatically including all files in the project root directory"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Gradle determines the source files included in a source set by using predefined directory structures based on the component name and the programming language. For example, for a C component named 'hello', the source files would typically be located in the 'src/hello/c' directory."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of defining multiple source sets for a component?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To allow for different versions of the same source files",
            "B": "To support multiple programming languages within the same component",
            "C": "To enable the use of different build tools for each source set",
            "D": "To create separate binaries for each source set"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Defining multiple source sets for a component allows for support of different programming languages within the same component. Each source set can contain files for a specific language, enabling Gradle to compile and link them appropriately, thus facilitating multi-language projects."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if a source file does not belong to any defined source set in a Gradle project?",
        "options": {
            "A": "It will be automatically included in the build process",
            "B": "It will be ignored and not compiled",
            "C": "It will cause a build error",
            "D": "It will be included in a default source set"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If a source file does not belong to any defined source set in a Gradle project, it will be ignored and not compiled. Gradle only processes files that are explicitly included in the defined source sets for each component."

    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of defining build types in a native software project?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To specify different versions of the same source code for various platforms",
            "B": "To determine non-functional aspects of a binary, such as optimization levels",
            "C": "To manage dependencies between different components of the project",
            "D": "To configure the user interface of the application"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Build types are used to define various non-functional aspects of a binary, such as whether debug information is included or what optimization level the binary is compiled with. Common examples of build types are 'debug' and 'release', which help in managing how the software is built and optimized."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do flavors differ from build types in a native software project?",
        "options": {
            "A": "Flavors are used to define the optimization level of the binaries",
            "B": "Flavors allow for different functional variations of the same component",
            "C": "Flavors are only applicable to library components, not executables",
            "D": "Flavors determine the operating system on which the software will run"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Flavors allow for different functional variations of the same component, enabling the creation of distinct versions of a binary that may have different features or behaviors. For example, a project might define flavors for 'demo', 'paid', and 'enterprise' editions, each with its own specific functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if no build types are defined in a Gradle project?",
        "options": {
            "A": "The project will not compile successfully",
            "B": "A single default build type called 'debug' is automatically added",
            "C": "All binaries will be built without any optimizations",
            "D": "The project will only produce release binaries"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If no build types are defined in a Gradle project, a single default build type called 'debug' is automatically added. This ensures that there is at least one build type available for the project, allowing for the inclusion of debug information and other settings typically associated with development."

    {
        "question": "In the context of native software development, what is a variant?",
        "options": {
            "A": "A specific version of a source file",
            "B": "A combination of build type, platform, and flavor for a binary",
            "C": "A tool used to compile the source code",
            "D": "A method for managing dependencies between components"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A variant in native software development refers to a specific combination of build type, platform, and flavor for a binary. This allows developers to produce different versions of the same software that may vary in functionality, performance, or compatibility based on the defined parameters."
