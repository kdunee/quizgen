To set configurations for downloading dependencies through a proxy<br>C. To manage user permissions for accessing the network<br>D. To specify the location of the Java installation,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>JVM system properties are used to set configurations for downloading dependencies through a proxy. By specifying properties such as `http.proxyHost` and `http.proxyPort`, users can direct the Java Virtual Machine to route network requests through a specified proxy server, facilitating access to external resources."
What is the primary purpose of a SOCKS proxy?<br><br>A. To provide a secure connection for file transfers<br>B. To route network traffic through a different server<br>C. To encrypt data during transmission<br>D. To manage user authentication for web services,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The primary purpose of a SOCKS proxy is to route network traffic through a different server. This allows clients to connect to the internet indirectly, which can help with bypassing restrictions, improving privacy, and managing network traffic more effectively."
What does 'execution time' refer to in the context of project properties?<br><br>A. The time when project properties are defined in the build script<br>B. The time when project properties are accessed during the build process<br>C. The time when the Gradle daemon starts<br>D. The time when the project is compiled,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Execution time refers to the moment during the build process when project properties are accessed and utilized. This is distinct from configuration time, which is when properties are defined. Understanding when properties are accessed is crucial for effective build script management."
Why is it important for a cacheable task to have a complete picture of its inputs and outputs?<br><br>A. To ensure that the task can run without any errors.<br>B. To allow the task to be executed in parallel with other tasks.<br>C. To safely reuse results from previous builds without incorrect cache hits.<br>D. To minimize the amount of disk space used by the build cache.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>Having a complete picture of a task's inputs and outputs is crucial for ensuring that results from previous builds can be safely reused. This prevents incorrect cache hits, where different results are treated as identical due to the same cache key being used, which can lead to build failures or incorrect outputs."
"What factors contribute to the uniqueness of a build cache key?<br><br>A. The project name and developer's name<br>B. The task implementation, task action implementations, output properties, and task inputs<br>C. The time of day the build is executed<br>D. The programming language used in the project","<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A build cache key is uniquely identified by several factors, including the task implementation, task action implementations, the names of the output properties, and the names and values of task inputs. These elements ensure that the cache can accurately determine whether a task's output can be reused."
Which of the following best describes a benefit of input normalization?<br><br>A. It guarantees that all tasks will produce the same output every time.<br>B. It allows Gradle to ignore irrelevant changes in task inputs.<br>C. It ensures that all tasks are executed in the same order.<br>D. It prevents any changes to task inputs during a build.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A key benefit of input normalization is that it allows Gradle to ignore irrelevant changes in task inputs, which can help avoid unnecessary task executions and improve build performance. This is particularly useful when certain inputs do not affect the outcome of the task."
Why is it important for tasks to declare their path sensitivity?<br><br>A. To ensure that all tasks can run from any directory without issues<br>B. To allow Gradle to determine which inputs can be shared across different environments<br>C. To prevent tasks from executing if their paths are not absolute<br>D. To enable tasks to ignore changes in file names during execution,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Declaring path sensitivity is important because it allows Gradle to understand which inputs can be shared across different environments, even when builds are executed from different root directories. This helps in optimizing the reuse of cached results and ensures that tasks can function correctly regardless of their execution context."
Which of the following can cause a cache miss?<br><br>A. All inputs to a task are specified correctly<br>B. A change in the implementation of a task<br>C. The build cache is enabled and functioning properly<br>D. The task has no outputs or inputs,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A change in the implementation of a task, such as modifications to the class names or classloader hashes, can lead to a cache miss. This is because the build cache key is based on the task's implementation, and any changes can result in a different key that does not match the cached version."
What is the primary goal of testing cache relocatability?<br><br>A. To ensure tasks can run without any inputs.<br>B. To verify that tasks can be executed in different directories without issues.<br>C. To check if tasks can be executed faster.<br>D. To confirm that all tasks produce the same output every time.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The primary goal of testing cache relocatability is to verify that tasks can be executed in different directories without issues. This ensures that the outputs can be reused across different locations, which is essential for efficient caching and build performance."
What is a common issue that can prevent tasks from being relocatable across different platforms?<br><br>A. Using relative paths in task configurations<br>B. Including absolute paths among the task's inputs<br>C. Running builds in different directories<br>D. Using the same Gradle version on all platforms,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A common issue that can prevent tasks from being relocatable across different platforms is including absolute paths among the task's inputs. Absolute paths can lead to discrepancies when the same task is executed in different locations, making it difficult for the build system to recognize that the outputs can be reused."
