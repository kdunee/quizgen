What annotation is used to apply a rule method to a target model element in Gradle?<br><br>A. Model<br>B. Rules<br>C. Target<br>D. Apply,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The annotation used to apply a rule method to a target model element in Gradle is the Rules annotation. This annotation indicates that the method should be treated as a rule that can modify or configure the specified model element, facilitating the application of additional rules in the build process."
What should new plugins avoid using according to the chapter's cautionary note?<br><br>A. The standard approach for writing custom plugins<br>B. The concept of rule-based configuration<br>C. The Gradle API documentation<br>D. The Plugin interface,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>According to the chapter's cautionary note, new plugins should avoid using the concept of rule-based configuration, as it is indicated to be deprecated.
