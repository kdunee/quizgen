An output property is incorrectly defined<br>D. A property is annotated with conflicting annotations,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The 'Missing normalization annotation' error indicates that a cacheable task or artifact transform does not declare how its file or file collection input properties should be normalized. Normalization is crucial for ensuring that outputs can be reused across different environments, and without it, caching becomes ineffective."
What should you do if you encounter the error 'Input file doesn't exist'?<br><br>A. Ensure the input file is correctly specified and exists before the task runs<br>B. Change the input file type to a directory<br>C. Remove the input file declaration from the task<br>D. Add a default value for the input file property,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>If you encounter the 'Input file doesn't exist' error, it typically means that the file expected as an input for a task is not present at the time the task is executed. To resolve this, you should ensure that the input file is correctly specified and that it exists before the task runs, often by checking task dependencies."
What does the error 'Invalid use of cacheable annotation' imply?<br><br>A. A task is not marked as cacheable when it should be<br>B. A cacheable annotation is applied to a non-cacheable type<br>C. A property is incorrectly annotated with multiple conflicting annotations<br>D. A task is missing required input annotations,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The 'Invalid use of cacheable annotation' error implies that a cacheable annotation, such as `@CacheableTransform` or `@CacheableTask`, has been applied to a type that does not support it.
