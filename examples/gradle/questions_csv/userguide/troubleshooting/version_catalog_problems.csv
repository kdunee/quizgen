What is the primary purpose of a version catalog in Gradle?<br><br>A. To manage and organize dependencies and their versions<br>B. To compile source code into executable files<br>C. To create user interfaces for applications<br>D. To store configuration settings for the build process,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The primary purpose of a version catalog in Gradle is to manage and organize dependencies along with their versions. This allows developers to define and reference libraries in a structured way, ensuring consistency and ease of updates across projects."
What happens if a version catalog contains too many entries?<br><br>A. It will automatically optimize the entries to fit the limit<br>B. An error will occur due to exceeding the maximum entry limit<br>C. The catalog will be ignored by Gradle<br>D. Gradle will merge the entries into a single entry,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>If a version catalog contains too many entries, an error will occur because Gradle imposes a limit on the number of aliases that can be included in a single catalog. This limit is currently set at 32,000 entries, and exceeding this limit requires splitting the catalog into multiple distinct catalogs."
What should you do if you encounter an 'undefined version reference' error in a version catalog?<br><br>A. Remove all version references from the catalog<br>B. Ensure the version reference points to an existing version alias<br>C. Change the catalog file format to JSON<br>D. Add more libraries to the catalog,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>If you encounter an 'undefined version reference' error, you should ensure that the version reference points to an existing version alias declared in the catalog. This error indicates that the catalog is trying to reference a version that has not been defined, which can be resolved by correcting the reference or declaring the missing version."
Which of the following is a common issue when using reserved alias names in a version catalog?<br><br>A. The alias will be ignored by Gradle<br>B. An error will occur due to a naming conflict with generated accessors<br>C. The alias will automatically be renamed by Gradle<br>D. The catalog will not load any libraries,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Using reserved alias names in a version catalog can lead to an error due to a naming conflict with generated accessors. Reserved names typically include those that start with 'versions', 'bundles', or 'plugins', and using them can cause issues in the catalog's functionality."
What is the primary purpose of a version catalog in dependency management?<br><br>A. To define and manage library versions and aliases in a centralized manner<br>B. To automatically update all dependencies to the latest versions<br>C. To create a backup of all project files and dependencies<br>D.

Declaring too many libraries in the catalog<br>D. Using a reserved alias name,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A common cause of the 'invalid dependency notation' error in a version catalog is incorrectly formatting the dependency notation.

What does the 'undefined version reference' error indicate in a version catalog?<br><br>A. A library references a version that does not exist.<br>B. A library is declared without an alias.<br>C. A version catalog contains too many entries.<br>D. An alias is using a reserved name.,<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The 'undefined version reference' error indicates that a library in the version catalog is trying to reference a version that has not been defined. This means that the version reference must either be corrected to point to an existing version or a new version must be declared in the catalog.
What is a common solution for the 'too many entries in a single catalog' error?<br><br>A. Remove all aliases from the catalog.<br>B. Split the catalog into multiple distinct catalogs.<br>C. Increase the maximum number of allowed entries.<br>D. Combine all entries into a single alias.,<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The 'too many entries in a single catalog' error occurs when the number of aliases exceeds the limit set by the JVM file format. The common solution is to split the catalog into multiple distinct catalogs to stay within the entry limit.
What does the 'invalid dependency notation' error signify?<br><br>A. The alias name is not unique.<br>B. The dependency notation does not follow the required format.<br>C. The catalog file is not found.<br>D. The version reference is undefined.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The 'invalid dependency notation' error indicates that the dependency notation associated with an alias does not conform to the expected format. This could mean that the notation is incorrectly structured, such as not using the 'group:artifact:version' format properly."
What is the purpose of the 'alias not finished' error message?<br><br>A. To indicate that an alias has been registered without a version.<br>B. To signal that an alias name is invalid.<br>C. To show that an alias is conflicting with another.<br>D. To inform that an alias has been successfully created.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The 'alias not finished' error message indicates that an alias builder was created but not properly registered with the catalog. This typically happens when the necessary method to finalize the alias, such as calling '.version()' or '.withoutVersion()', has not been executed."
What is a key requirement for alias names in a Gradle version catalog?<br><br>A. Alias names must start with a number.<br>B. Alias names must match a specific regular expression.<br>C. Alias names can contain any special characters.<br>D. Alias names must be unique across all catalogs.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Alias names in a Gradle version catalog must match a specific regular expression: `[a-z]([a-zA-Z0-9_.\-])+`.
