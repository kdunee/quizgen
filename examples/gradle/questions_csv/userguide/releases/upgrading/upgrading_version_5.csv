To manage the versions and repositories of plugins used in the build.<br>C. To configure the build script dependencies.<br>D. To specify the tasks that should be executed during the build.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The `pluginManagement` block in Gradle is used to manage the versions and repositories of plugins that are applied to the project. It allows users to specify where to find plugins and what versions to use, ensuring consistency across builds."
How does the `pluginManagement` block affect the resolution of plugins in Gradle?<br><br>A. It automatically applies all plugins defined within it.<br>B. It isolates plugin configurations from the rest of the build script.<br>C. It allows for the configuration of plugin repositories and versions before plugins are applied.<br>D. It prevents any plugins from being applied to the project.,<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>The `pluginManagement` block allows for the configuration of plugin repositories and versions before the plugins are applied. This ensures that the correct versions of plugins are used and that they are sourced from the specified repositories.
What happens if a `pluginManagement` block is not used in a Gradle build script?<br><br>A. Plugins will not be applied to the project.<br>B.

This means that the configuration of one task can depend on the outputs or states of other tasks, allowing for dynamic and flexible build processes. However, task configuration typically occurs before task execution."
What happens if a task's inputs or outputs are not properly defined?<br><br>A. The task will execute regardless of changes.<br>B. Gradle will skip the task execution.<br>C. The build will fail immediately.<br>D. Gradle will not be able to determine if the task is up-to-date.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> D<br><br>If a task's inputs or outputs are not properly defined, Gradle will not be able to determine if the task is up-to-date.

What is the primary purpose of the build cache in Gradle?<br><br>A. To store build artifacts for future use<br>B. To speed up the build process by reusing outputs from previous builds<br>C. To manage dependencies between projects<br>D. To provide a user interface for build configuration,<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The primary purpose of the build cache in Gradle is to speed up the build process by reusing outputs from previous builds. This allows Gradle to avoid unnecessary work by using cached results instead of re-executing tasks that have already been completed successfully.
Which type of build cache is required for local builds in Gradle 6.0?<br><br>A. Custom build cache implementations<br>B. Directory build cache<br>C. Remote build cache<br>D. In-memory build cache,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>In Gradle 6.0, the local build cache must always be a Directory build cache.
