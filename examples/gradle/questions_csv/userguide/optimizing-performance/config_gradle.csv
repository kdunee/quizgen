What happens if a project property is not defined when invoking a Gradle build?<br><br>A. The build will fail immediately<br>B. The default value will be used if specified in the build script<br>C. The property will be ignored and not affect the build<br>D. The build will automatically create the property with a null value,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>If a project property is not defined when invoking a Gradle build, the build script can specify default values for those properties.
