To track changes in source code<br>D. To manage dependencies automatically,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The primary purpose of build caching in Gradle is to reuse outputs from previous builds, which significantly improves build performance by avoiding unnecessary re-execution of tasks. This allows developers to save time and resources by leveraging already computed results."
Which of the following can lead to cache misses in a Gradle build?<br><br>A. Using the same inputs for a task across different builds<br>B. Changing environment variables without tracking them as inputs<br>C. Consistently using the same version of dependencies<br>D. Setting the same file encoding for all builds,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Cache misses can occur when environment variables that affect task outcomes are changed without being tracked as inputs. This inconsistency can lead to different outputs for the same task, preventing Gradle from effectively reusing cached results."
What is a recommended practice to ensure stable task inputs in Gradle?<br><br>A. Use volatile inputs like timestamps as task inputs<br>B. Track all external dependencies and their versions<br>C. Modify task inputs dynamically during execution<br>D.

They can lead to cache misses if the destination content changes.<br>C. They do not affect caching at all.<br>D. They are treated as absolute paths in the cache.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Using symbolic links can lead to cache misses because Gradle stores the actual file contents of the destination rather than the link itself. If the content of the destination changes, it can affect the cacheability of tasks that depend on those links."
"What is the significance of declaring task inputs and outputs in Gradle?<br><br>A. It allows Gradle to determine if a task needs to be executed based on changes to inputs.<br>B. It ensures that all tasks will always execute regardless of input changes.<br>C. It prevents any caching of task outputs, ensuring fresh builds every time.<br>D. It allows for the automatic generation of task dependencies without any configuration.","<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>Declaring task inputs and outputs is crucial in Gradle as it enables the build system to determine whether a task needs to be executed.

What does Gradle primarily track regarding Java versions for compilation and test execution?<br><br>A. The major version of Java<br>B. The vendor and minor version of Java<br>C. The full version string of Java<br>D. The Java version used in the IDE,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>Gradle tracks only the major version of Java as an input for compilation and test execution. This means that while the major version is important for determining compatibility, the vendor and minor version are not tracked, which can lead to differences in bytecode produced by different Java vendors or minor versions."

To avoid using deprecated features<br>D. To manage memory usage during builds,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>Tracking the Java vendor is important because different vendors may produce different bytecode for the same source code, even if the major version is the same. By adding the vendor as an input to tasks, developers can ensure that the outputs are consistent and cacheable across different environments."
What is a potential consequence of not tracking the minor version of Java in Gradle builds?<br><br>A. Increased build time due to unnecessary recompilation<br>B. Cache misses for developers using different minor versions<br>C. Incompatibility with third-party libraries<br>D. Failure to compile the project,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Not tracking the minor version of Java can lead to cache misses for developers who are using different minor versions. This is because even though the major version may be the same, differences in the minor version can affect the bytecode produced, leading to inconsistencies in the outputs and preventing effective reuse of cached results."
What should developers consider when deciding whether to track the Java minor version in Gradle?<br><br>A. The frequency of changes in the major version<br>B. The impact on cache hits versus the need for consistent results<br>C. The size of the Java libraries used<br>D. The number of developers on the team,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>When deciding whether to track the Java minor version, developers should weigh the impact on cache hits against the need for consistent results.
