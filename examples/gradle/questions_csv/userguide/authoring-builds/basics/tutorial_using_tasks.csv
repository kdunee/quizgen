To add actions that should occur after the main task actions<br>D. To remove actions from a task,<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>The 'doLast' method in task configuration is used to add actions that should occur after the main actions of the task have been executed. This allows developers to specify additional behavior that should happen once the primary task work is complete.
