Which practice is recommended to avoid coupling issues in Gradle?<br><br>A. Use `allprojects{}` in build scripts to share configurations.<br>B. Reference other subprojects' build scripts directly.<br>C. Prefer cross-configuration from the root project.<br>D. Dynamically change other projects' configurations during execution.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>To avoid coupling issues in Gradle, it is recommended to prefer cross-configuration from the root project. This approach minimizes direct interactions between subprojects, thereby reducing the risk of coupling that can lead to build problems."
What is the primary benefit of enabling parallel execution in Gradle?<br><br>A. To reduce the overall build time by utilizing CPU resources more effectively<br>B. To ensure that all tasks are executed in alphabetical order<br>C. To allow projects to modify each other's configurations during execution<br>D. To configure all projects simultaneously regardless of dependencies,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The primary benefit of enabling parallel execution in Gradle is to reduce the overall build time by utilizing CPU resources more effectively. By executing tasks from different projects concurrently, Gradle can optimize CPU utilization, leading to faster builds, especially in multi-project setups."
How does Gradle determine the number of parallel threads to use during execution?<br><br>A. It is manually set by the user in the build script<br>B. It is based on the number of projects in the build<br>C. It automatically determines the optimal number based on CPU cores<br>D. It uses a fixed number of threads regardless of the system's capabilities,<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>Gradle automatically determines the optimal number of parallel threads based on the number of CPU cores available on the system. This allows Gradle to efficiently utilize system resources and maximize performance during the build process.
What is a critical consideration when using parallel execution in Gradle?<br><br>A. Tasks must be executed in a specific order to avoid conflicts<br>B. All projects must be coupled to ensure proper execution<br>C. Task dependencies and inputs/outputs must be correctly declared<br>D. Parallel execution can only be used with decoupled projects,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>A critical consideration when using parallel execution in Gradle is that task dependencies and inputs/outputs must be correctly declared. This ensures that tasks are executed in the correct order and that dependencies are respected, preventing potential issues during the build process."
What is the primary purpose of declaring task dependencies in Gradle?<br><br>A. To ensure tasks are executed in a specific order<br>B. To reduce the overall build time<br>C. To allow tasks to run concurrently without any restrictions<br>D. To automatically configure all projects in a build,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The primary purpose of declaring task dependencies in Gradle is to ensure that tasks are executed in a specific order. This is important because some tasks may rely on the outputs of others, and declaring dependencies helps Gradle understand the sequence in which tasks should be executed to achieve the desired build outcome."
"What happens if task dependencies are not correctly declared in a Gradle build?<br><br>A. All tasks will execute in alphabetical order.<br>B. Tasks may execute out of order, leading to potential build failures.<br>C. The build will automatically optimize itself without any issues.<br>D. Gradle will skip the execution of all tasks.","<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>If task dependencies are not correctly declared in a Gradle build, tasks may execute out of order, which can lead to potential build failures. Properly declaring dependencies ensures that tasks that rely on the outputs of other tasks are executed only after those tasks have completed successfully."
"In the context of Gradle, what is a consequence of coupling between projects during task execution?<br><br>A. It enhances the performance of the build process.<br>B.
