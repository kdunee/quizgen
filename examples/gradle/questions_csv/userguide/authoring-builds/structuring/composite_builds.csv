How can a composite build declare task dependencies on included builds?<br><br>A. By directly referencing the tasks in the main build's configuration<br>B. By using the Gradle API to access included builds and their tasks<br>C. By modifying the settings.gradle file to include task definitions<br>D. By creating a separate build for each task dependency,<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A composite build can declare task dependencies on included builds by using the Gradle API to access the included builds and their tasks. This allows for a structured way to manage task execution across different builds while maintaining their isolation.
What is a key limitation of composite builds regarding included builds?<br><br>A. They cannot include builds that define Gradle plugins<br>B. They do not allow for task execution from included builds<br>C. They may conflict when multiple composite builds include the same build<br>D. They require all included builds to be in the same programming language,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>A key limitation of composite builds is that they may conflict when multiple composite builds include the same build.

What is a key restriction when declaring dependencies on tasks in included builds?<br><br>A. Included builds can directly share task dependencies with each other<br>B. Tasks in included builds cannot declare direct dependencies on the main build<br>C. Tasks must be executed in the order they are declared in the build file<br>D. All tasks must be executed in parallel to improve performance,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A key restriction when declaring dependencies on tasks in included builds is that tasks in included builds cannot declare direct dependencies on the main build. This isolation ensures that each build remains independent, while still allowing the composite build to manage task dependencies effectively."
What happens when a task from an included build is executed in a composite build?<br><br>A. Only the task itself is executed without any dependencies<br>B. All tasks required to build dependency artifacts from other included builds are executed<br>C. The task is ignored if it belongs to an included build<br>D. The task is executed only if it is marked as a main build task,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>When a task from an included build is executed in a composite build, all tasks required to build dependency artifacts from other included builds are also executed. This ensures that all necessary dependencies are resolved and built before the main task is executed, maintaining the integrity of the build process."
