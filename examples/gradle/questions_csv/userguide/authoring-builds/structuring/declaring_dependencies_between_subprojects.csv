"What happens to the classpath when a project dependency is declared?<br><br>A. The classpath is cleared to avoid conflicts.<br>B. Only the classes of the dependent project are added to the classpath.<br>C. The output classes of the dependent project and its dependencies are added to the classpath.<br>D. The classpath is set to a default value, ignoring project dependencies.","<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>When a project dependency is declared, the output classes of the dependent project, along with its dependencies, are added to the classpath.
