To manage dependencies between projects<br>D. To define the structure of a build script,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The primary purpose of properties in Gradle is to hold values that can be defined and accessed within a build script. They are used to store information such as file paths, version numbers, or custom values, allowing for dynamic configuration of the build process."
How can properties in Gradle be modified?<br><br>A. By using the `set()` method on the property<br>B. By directly changing the value in the build script<br>C. By deleting the property and creating a new one<br>D. By using the `get()` method on the property,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>Properties in Gradle can be modified by using the `set()` method on the property.

A Property is read-only, while a Provider is mutable<br>C. A Property is used for lazy evaluation, while a Provider is not<br>D. A Property is a type of task, while a Provider is a type of dependency","<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The distinction between a `Property` and a `Provider` in Gradle is that a `Property` can be queried and changed, while a `Provider` can only be queried. This means that `Properties` are mutable and can be set to new values, whereas `Providers` are read-only and represent values that may not be immediately available."
What is a managed property in Gradle?<br><br>A. A property that Gradle automatically manages its state for<br>B. A property that can only be accessed by the build script<br>C. A property that is defined using concrete setter and getter methods<br>D.

What is a key characteristic of named managed types in Gradle?<br><br>A. They have a unique identifier that is not modifiable<br>B. They include an abstract property called 'name' of type String<br>C. They can only be used in conjunction with Java Bean properties<br>D. They must have at least one concrete field defined,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Named managed types in Gradle are characterized by having an abstract property called 'name' of type String.
