To execute the tasks defined in the build scripts<br>C. To configure project objects using build scripts<br>D. To create a dependency graph of all available tasks,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>The configuration phase is primarily focused on configuring the `Project` objects using the build scripts of all projects involved in the build. During this phase, Gradle determines the set of tasks that will be executed based on the configurations specified in the build scripts."
During which phase does Gradle create a `Project` instance for each project?<br><br>A. Execution phase<br>B. Configuration phase<br>C. Initialization phase<br>D. Finalization phase,<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>The initialization phase is when Gradle creates a `Project` instance for each project that will participate in the build. This phase sets the stage for the subsequent configuration and execution phases.
What happens during the execution phase of the Gradle build lifecycle?<br><br>A. Gradle determines which projects to include in the build<br>B. Gradle executes the selected tasks<br>C. Gradle configures the project objects<br>D. Gradle creates a dependency graph of tasks,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>During the execution phase, Gradle executes each of the selected tasks that were determined during the configuration phase. This is the phase where the actual work defined by the tasks is carried out."
What is meant by 'task configuration avoidance' in Gradle?<br><br>A. Gradle avoids executing tasks that are not needed<br>B. Gradle skips the initialization phase for certain tasks<br>C. Gradle does not configure tasks that are not dependencies of the executed task<br>D. Gradle prevents the creation of project instances for unused projects,<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>Task configuration avoidance refers to Gradle's ability to skip the configuration of tasks that are not required for the execution of the task being run. This optimization helps to prevent unnecessary work and improves build performance.

During which phase of the Gradle build lifecycle does task configuration avoidance occur?<br><br>A. Initialization phase<br>B. Configuration phase<br>C. Execution phase<br>D. Finalization phase,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Task configuration avoidance occurs during the configuration phase of the Gradle build lifecycle. In this phase, Gradle determines which tasks need to be configured based on the tasks that are being executed, thereby avoiding the configuration of tasks that are not necessary."
What happens to a task that is not configured due to task configuration avoidance?<br><br>A. It is executed immediately without any configuration.<br>B. It is ignored and not included in the build process.<br>C. It remains in a pending state until explicitly called.<br>D. It is configured but not executed.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>When a task is not configured due to task configuration avoidance, it is ignored and not included in the build process. This helps streamline the build by ensuring that only necessary tasks are configured and executed, thus improving efficiency."
