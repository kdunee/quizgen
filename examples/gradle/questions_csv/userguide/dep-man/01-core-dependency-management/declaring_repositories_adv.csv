It dynamically generates a module descriptor based on the presence of artifacts.<br>C. It is primarily used for hosting public open-source libraries.<br>D. It requires a specific URL format for declaration.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A flat directory repository in Gradle dynamically generates a module descriptor based on the presence of artifacts, rather than using metadata formats like Ivy XML or Maven POM files. This means it does not support any metadata and relies solely on the files present in the directory."
What is the significance of the order in which repositories are declared in Gradle?<br><br>A. It determines the priority of dependency resolution.<br>B. It affects the build execution time.<br>C. It defines the types of dependencies that can be used.<br>D.

The order affects the speed of the build process<br>C. The order is irrelevant as Gradle checks all repositories simultaneously<br>D. The order only matters for public repositories, not custom ones","<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The order of declared repositories in Gradle is important because it determines which repository will be used for all dependency resolutions. If Gradle finds a module descriptor in a particular repository, it will prioritize that repository for downloading all related artifacts."
What is the primary purpose of repository content filtering in Gradle?<br><br>A. To specify which artifacts a repository may contain<br>B. To enhance the speed of dependency resolution<br>C. To automatically update dependencies from all repositories<br>D. To allow Gradle to ignore all repository declarations,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The primary purpose of repository content filtering in Gradle is to specify which artifacts a repository may or may not contain.

An artifact declared in a repository cannot be found in any other repository.<br>C. All artifacts are available to all repositories.<br>D. Only public repositories can have exclusive contents.","<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Declaring exclusive repository contents means that an artifact declared in a repository cannot be found in any other repository. This ensures that specific artifacts are only available from designated repositories, enhancing control over dependency resolution."

Why is it recommended to avoid including credentials directly in the build script?<br><br>A. It can lead to slower build performance.<br>B. It poses a security risk by exposing sensitive information.<br>C. It makes the build script less readable.<br>D. It can cause compatibility issues with different Gradle versions.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Including credentials directly in the build script poses a significant security risk as it exposes sensitive information. Instead, it is recommended to externalize credentials and manage them through secure means, such as environment variables or Gradle properties."

Gradle will fail the build immediately.<br>C. Gradle will prompt the user for credentials.<br>D. Gradle will use default credentials to access the repository.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>If Gradle cannot find the required credentials for a secured repository, it will fail the build immediately. This is to prevent any unauthorized access and ensure that builds do not proceed without the necessary authentication."
What is the primary benefit of centralizing repository declarations in Gradle?<br><br>A. To ensure all projects use the same repository configurations<br>B. To allow each project to have its own unique repositories<br>C. To increase the complexity of repository management<br>D.

What happens if a project declares its own repositories in addition to those declared centrally?<br><br>A. The central repositories will be ignored completely.<br>B. The project will use only the central repositories.<br>C. The project will override the central repositories.<br>D. The project will merge both sets of repositories.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>When a project declares its own repositories, those repositories will override any repositories declared in the settings.gradle file. This allows for flexibility in managing dependencies specific to a project while still providing a central configuration."
What is one of the modes for dependency resolution management in Gradle?<br><br>A. PREFER_PROJECT<br>B. IGNORE_PROJECT<br>C. ALLOW_PROJECT<br>D. REJECT_PROJECT,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>One of the modes for dependency resolution management in Gradle is PREFER_PROJECT.
