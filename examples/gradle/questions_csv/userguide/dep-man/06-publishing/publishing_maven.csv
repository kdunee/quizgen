What is the primary purpose of publishing a relocation POM in Maven?<br><br>A. To inform users about changes in artifact coordinates<br>B. To increase the version number of an artifact<br>C. To create a backup of the original artifact<br>D. To enhance the performance of the build process,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The primary purpose of publishing a relocation POM in Maven is to inform users about changes in artifact coordinates, such as when a project's groupId or artifactId has changed. This allows users to easily find the new location of the artifact and helps prevent confusion regarding where to obtain the updated version."
Which of the following is a requirement when specifying a relocation POM?<br><br>A. All properties of the artifact must be specified<br>B. Only the changed properties need to be specified<br>C. The version must always be incremented<br>D. The relocation POM must be published for every version of the artifact,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>When specifying a relocation POM, only the properties that have changed, such as groupId or artifactId, need to be specified. Other properties are optional, allowing for a more streamlined process when informing users about the new artifact location."

Remove the relocation configuration from the build file<br>C. Publish the relocation POM again for future versions<br>D. Notify all users manually about the change,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>After a relocation POM has been published, the relocation configuration should be removed from the build file. This prevents confusion and ensures that the build file remains clean and focused on the current artifact configuration."
What is a potential issue that can arise when only the coordinates of an artifact change?<br><br>A. Increased build time due to additional dependencies<br>B. Dependency conflicts due to duplicate classes<br>C. Loss of metadata associated with the artifact<br>D. Incompatibility with older versions of Maven,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>When only the coordinates of an artifact change, dependency conflicts can occur if both the old and new artifacts contain the same classes. This can lead to issues where a project depends on both versions, potentially causing incompatibilities and confusion in the build process."
