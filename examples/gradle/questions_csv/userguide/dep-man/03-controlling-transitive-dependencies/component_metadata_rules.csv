This attribute indicates the maturity level of a module and is considered during the version selection process, allowing Gradle to select the highest version that meets the specified status criteria."
What happens if a module's status is set to 'integration' during version selection?<br><br>A. It will be ignored in favor of stable releases.<br>B. It will be selected only if no other versions are available.<br>C. It will be prioritized over all other statuses.<br>D. It will select the highest version regardless of its maturity.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>If a module's status is set to 'integration', it will typically be ignored in favor of stable releases during version selection. The 'integration' status is considered the least mature, meaning that Gradle will prefer versions with a higher maturity status, such as 'release' or 'milestone', when available."
How can a custom status scheme affect version selection?<br><br>A. By allowing any version to be selected regardless of its status.<br>B. By changing the order of maturity levels considered during selection.<br>C. By enforcing a single version across all dependencies.<br>D. By automatically updating all dependencies to their latest versions.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A custom status scheme can affect version selection by changing the order of maturity levels considered during the selection process.

This attribute determines how Gradle interprets the maturity of a module and affects the selection of versions based on their defined statuses.
How does Gradle determine the status of a module when using different metadata formats?<br><br>A. It always defaults to 'release' status.<br>B. It uses the status defined in the module's metadata.<br>C. It ignores the status and selects the latest version.<br>D. It assigns a random status to each module.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Gradle determines the status of a module based on the status defined in the module's metadata. For example, in Gradle Module Metadata, it uses the published value for the 'org.gradle.status' attribute, while in Ivy metadata, it defaults to 'integration' if no status is defined."
What happens when a custom status scheme is applied to a component in Gradle?<br><br>A. It restricts the module to only one version.<br>B. It allows for more flexible version selection based on maturity levels.<br>C. It prevents any version from being selected.<br>D. It automatically updates all dependencies to the latest version.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>When a custom status scheme is applied to a component in Gradle, it allows for more flexible version selection based on maturity levels.
