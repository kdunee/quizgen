What are direct dependencies in the context of a software component?<br><br>A. Dependencies that are required by another dependency<br>B. Dependencies that are directly required by the component itself<br>C. Dependencies that are optional and not necessary for the component<br>D. Dependencies that are automatically included by the build system,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Direct dependencies are those that are directly required by a software component. They are essential for the component's functionality and must be explicitly declared in the build configuration. This distinguishes them from transitive dependencies, which are needed only because another dependency requires them."
Why is it important to correctly declare direct dependencies in a project?<br><br>A. To ensure that all transitive dependencies are automatically included<br>B. To avoid conflicts with other projects using the same dependencies<br>C. To provide clarity on what the component specifically needs to function<br>D. To reduce the overall size of the project,<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>Correctly declaring direct dependencies is crucial for providing clarity on what a component specifically needs to function.
