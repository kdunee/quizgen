As strict version requirements that cannot be overridden<br>C. As recommendations for dependency versions<br>D. As metadata for project documentation,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>Gradle treats entries in the `<dependencyManagement>` block of a BOM as recommendations for dependency versions. This means that while they suggest specific versions, they can be overridden by other version declarations in the project if necessary."
