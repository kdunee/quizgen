"What is the difference between forced dependencies and strict dependencies?<br><br>A. Forced dependencies are always optional, while strict dependencies are mandatory<br>B. Forced dependencies override all other versions, while strict dependencies can lead to build failures if conflicts arise<br>C. Strict dependencies are only used in testing, while forced dependencies are used in production<br>D. There is no difference; they are two terms for the same concept","<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The difference between forced dependencies and strict dependencies is that forced dependencies override all other versions found in the dependency graph, while strict dependencies can lead to build failures if there are conflicting versions. Strict dependencies require careful management to avoid resolution errors, especially when different parts of the project depend on different versions."
What are transitive dependencies in the context of software projects?<br><br>A. Dependencies that are directly declared in a project.<br>B. Dependencies that are required by other dependencies.<br>C. Dependencies that are optional and not required for the project to run.<br>D. Dependencies that are only used during development.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Transitive dependencies are those that are not directly declared by a project but are required by the project's direct dependencies. When a library depends on another library, the second library becomes a transitive dependency of the first.

What should be considered before excluding a transitive dependency?<br><br>A. The excluded dependency must be the only one in the project<br>B. Excluding a dependency may lead to runtime errors if not properly tested<br>C. Exclusions automatically resolve all dependency conflicts<br>D. Exclusions are always the best solution for dependency management,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Before excluding a transitive dependency, it is crucial to consider that doing so may lead to runtime errors if the excluded dependency is required by the code. Sufficient test coverage is necessary to ensure that the code does not rely on the excluded dependency, as this could result in unexpected errors during execution."
How does Gradle handle exclusions in relation to multiple dependencies?<br><br>A. Exclusions apply only to the first declared dependency<br>B. Exclusions are ignored if any dependency does not agree on them<br>C. Exclusions automatically apply to all dependencies in the project<br>D. Exclusions can be applied without any consideration of other dependencies,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>In Gradle, exclusions are only exercised if all dependency declarations agree on them. This means that if one dependency excludes a transitive dependency, but another does not, the exclusion will not take effect. This approach ensures that the entire dependency graph is considered, preventing potential issues that could arise from inconsistent exclusions."
