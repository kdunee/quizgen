To automatically resolve all conflicts without user intervention,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The primary goal of dependency management is to control and maintain the versions of libraries and modules used in a project. This ensures that the correct versions are used consistently, which helps prevent issues related to version conflicts and ensures reproducibility in builds."
What happens during a version conflict in dependency management?<br><br>A. The build process is automatically stopped without any notification<br>B. The highest version of the conflicting dependencies is selected by default<br>C. All versions of the conflicting dependencies are ignored<br>D. The project is rebuilt with the lowest version of the dependencies,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>During a version conflict, the default behavior in dependency management is to perform optimistic upgrades, meaning that if multiple versions of a dependency are found, the highest version is selected.

Transitive dependencies do not affect the final build<br>D. Dependencies are always resolved in the order they are declared,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>A common misconception about dependency graphs in Gradle is that there is only one dependency graph for an entire application. In reality, Gradle resolves multiple distinct dependency graphs during a build, such as those for compile time and runtime, which can lead to different versions of dependencies being used in different contexts."

What happens when there is a version conflict in a dependency graph?<br><br>A. The build process is automatically canceled<br>B. The highest version of the dependency is chosen by default<br>C. All versions of the dependency are included in the build<br>D. The dependency graph is ignored,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>When there is a version conflict in a dependency graph, the default behavior is for the build system to perform optimistic upgrades, meaning it will resolve to the highest version of the conflicting dependency. This can lead to unexpected behavior if not properly managed."

Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between compile and runtime classpaths in Gradle?<br><br>A. The compile classpath always influences the runtime classpath directly.<br>B. The runtime classpath can be a superset of the compile classpath.<br>C. The compile classpath and runtime classpath are always identical.<br>D. The runtime classpath cannot include any dependencies from the compile classpath.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>In Gradle, the runtime classpath can be a superset of the compile classpath, meaning it may include additional dependencies that are not present during compilation. This can lead to situations where the versions of dependencies differ between the two classpaths, which is why configuration consistency is important."
What happens if the versions of dependencies cannot be aligned when declaring consistency between configurations?<br><br>A. Gradle will automatically select the highest version available.<br>B. The build will fail with a call to action.<br>C. Gradle will ignore the consistency declaration and proceed with the build.<br>D. The build will succeed but with warnings about the version mismatch.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>If the versions of dependencies cannot be aligned when declaring consistency between configurations, Gradle will fail the build with a call to action.
