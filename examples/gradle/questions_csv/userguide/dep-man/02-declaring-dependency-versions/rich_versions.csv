To enforce a single version for all dependencies,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The purpose of version constraints is to specify acceptable versions of dependencies, allowing developers to control which versions can be used in their projects. This helps ensure compatibility and stability by defining clear boundaries for dependency versions."
Which version constraint type is the strongest and excludes any version not matched?<br><br>A. require<br>B. prefer<br>C. strictly<br>D. reject,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>The 'strictly' version constraint is the strongest type, as it excludes any version that does not match the specified notation. This ensures that only the defined versions are accepted, providing a high level of control over dependency versions."
What does the 'require' version constraint imply?<br><br>A. The selected version must be lower than the specified version<br>B. The selected version cannot be lower than the specified version but can be higher<br>C. The selected version must be exactly the specified version<br>D. The selected version is optional and can be ignored,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>'Require' implies that the selected version cannot be lower than what is specified, but it can be higher if there are conflicts. This allows for flexibility in version selection while maintaining a minimum version requirement."
What is the function of the 'reject' version constraint?<br><br>A. To specify that certain versions are acceptable<br>B. To declare specific versions that are not accepted<br>C. To allow any version to be used without restrictions<br>D. To automatically select the latest version available,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The 'reject' version constraint is used to declare specific versions that are not accepted for a module. If a selected version is rejected, dependency resolution will fail, ensuring that incompatible versions are not used."
What is the primary purpose of semantic versioning?<br><br>A. To indicate the level of compatibility between software versions<br>B. To provide a marketing strategy for software releases<br>C. To enforce strict licensing agreements<br>D. To simplify the installation process of software,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The primary purpose of semantic versioning is to indicate the level of compatibility between software versions. It uses a versioning scheme that consists of three numbers (major, minor, and patch) to communicate changes in the software, helping developers understand the impact of upgrading to a new version."
"In semantic versioning, what does a change in the major version number signify?<br><br>A. Backward-compatible changes<br>B. New features added<br>C. Incompatible API changes<br>D. Bug fixes","<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>In semantic versioning, a change in the major version number signifies incompatible API changes.

Which term in dependency resolution indicates that a specific version of a module is not accepted?<br><br>A. require<br>B. prefer<br>C. strictly<br>D. reject,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> D<br><br>The term 'reject' in dependency resolution indicates that specific version(s) of a module are not accepted. This declaration will cause the dependency resolution process to fail if the selected version is among those that are rejected, ensuring that incompatible versions are not used."
What does the 'strictly' version declaration imply in dependency resolution?<br><br>A. It allows for any version of a module to be used.<br>B. It excludes any version not matched by the specified version notation.<br>C. It suggests a preferred version but allows for flexibility.<br>D. It indicates that the version can be downgraded without restrictions.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>'Strictly' is the strongest version declaration in dependency resolution, meaning that any version not matched by this notation will be excluded. This ensures that only the specified version or compatible versions are used, preventing potential issues with incompatible dependencies."
"In the context of dependency resolution, what does the 'prefer' declaration do?<br><br>A. It mandates the use of a specific version only.<br>B. It applies only if there is no stronger non-dynamic opinion on a version.<br>C. It automatically rejects all other versions.<br>D. It enforces a downgrade of the current version.","<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The 'prefer' declaration in dependency resolution is a soft version declaration that applies only if there is no stronger non-dynamic opinion on a version of the module.
