What is a dynamic version in the context of dependency management?<br><br>A. A fixed version that does not change over time<br>B. A version that allows for the latest version or a range of versions to be used<br>C. A version that is only applicable to production environments<br>D. A version that is guaranteed to be stable and compatible,<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A dynamic version allows for the latest version or a range of versions to be used in dependency management. This flexibility is useful during development or when creating libraries that need to be compatible with various versions of dependencies.
What is a potential risk of using dynamic versions in a project?<br><br>A. They always lead to faster build times<br>B. They can cause unreproducible builds due to API changes<br>C. They ensure that all dependencies are always up to date<br>D. They eliminate the need for version control in projects,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Using dynamic versions can lead to unreproducible builds because as new versions of a dependency are released, they may introduce incompatible API changes. This can result in the source code failing to compile if it relies on a specific API that has changed."
How does Gradle handle caching for dynamic versions by default?<br><br>A. It caches them indefinitely without checking for updates<br>B. It caches them for 24 hours before checking for new versions<br>C. It does not cache dynamic versions at all<br>D. It caches them for 1 hour and then checks for updates,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>By default, Gradle caches dynamic versions for 24 hours. During this time, it does not attempt to resolve newer versions from the declared repositories, which helps to reduce unnecessary network calls and improve build performance."
What is a common use case for declaring a dynamic version?<br><br>A. To ensure that a project always uses the same version of a dependency<br>B. To integrate the latest features of a dependency during development<br>C. To avoid using any external libraries in a project<br>D. To lock a dependency to a specific version for production,<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A common use case for declaring a dynamic version is to integrate the latest features of a dependency during development. This allows developers to take advantage of cutting-edge updates without having to manually change the version number each time a new release occurs.
What is a changing version in the context of dependency management?<br><br>A. A version that is stable and ready for production use<br>B. A version that is still under active development and may change frequently<br>C. A version that is locked and cannot be modified<br>D. A version that is only used for testing purposes,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A changing version refers to a version of a module that is still under active development and has not yet been released as a stable version.

Reduced network usage,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Using dynamic versions can lead to unreproducible builds because as new versions of a particular module are published, their APIs may become incompatible with the existing source code. This can cause builds to fail unexpectedly when a new version is resolved."
What is the purpose of controlling dynamic version caching in Gradle?<br><br>A. To ensure all dependencies are downloaded every time<br>B. To manage how often Gradle checks for new versions<br>C. To eliminate the need for versioning<br>D. To speed up the build process by avoiding dependency resolution,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Controlling dynamic version caching allows developers to manage how often Gradle checks for new versions of dependencies. By adjusting the time-to-live (TTL) threshold, developers can specify whether Gradle should resolve new versions more frequently or maintain the default caching duration."
What is a changing version in the context of Gradle?<br><br>A. A version that is fixed and does not change<br>B. A version that is under active development and may change frequently<br>C. A version that is only used for testing purposes<br>D. A version that is deprecated and no longer supported,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A changing version indicates that the feature set is still under active development and has not yet been released as a stable version. This allows consumers to integrate unfinished versions of artifacts early and often, which is common in development workflows."
What is the primary purpose of component selection rules in Gradle?<br><br>A. To specify the exact version of a dependency to use<br>B. To influence which component instance should be selected when multiple versions are available<br>C. To automatically update all dependencies to their latest versions<br>D. To lock dependencies to a specific version for all builds,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The primary purpose of component selection rules in Gradle is to influence which component instance should be selected when multiple versions are available. These rules allow for explicit rejection of certain versions based on defined conditions, ensuring that only acceptable versions are considered for selection."
How are component selection rules applied when resolving dependencies?<br><br>A. They are applied only to the latest version of a dependency<br>B. They are applied starting with the highest version first<br>C. They are applied randomly to any available version<br>D. They are applied only to static versions of dependencies,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Component selection rules are applied starting with the highest version first. The version selected will be the first one that all component selection rules accept, ensuring that the most suitable version is chosen based on the defined criteria."
What happens if a version of a module is explicitly rejected by a component selection rule?<br><br>A. The version will be selected anyway if it is the latest<br>B. The version will be ignored and not considered for selection<br>C. The version will be marked for future consideration<br>D. The version will be automatically updated to the next available version,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>If a version of a module is explicitly rejected by a component selection rule, that version will be ignored and not considered for selection. This allows developers to control which versions are acceptable for their projects based on specific criteria."
Which of the following can be considered when applying component selection rules?<br><br>A. Only the version number of the dependency<br>B. Component metadata and additional attributes<br>C. The popularity of the dependency in the community<br>D. The date of the last update of the dependency,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Component selection rules can consider component metadata and additional attributes when selecting a version. This allows for more informed decisions based on the characteristics of the components, rather than relying solely on version numbers."
