Why are flat directory repositories generally discouraged in Gradle?<br><br>A. They require complex authentication methods.<br>B. They do not support metadata formats like Ivy XML or Maven POM files.<br>C. They are only suitable for local development environments.<br>D. They can only be used for Ivy dependencies.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Flat directory repositories are discouraged because they do not support metadata formats such as Ivy XML or Maven POM files. This lack of support can lead to issues with dependency resolution and management, making it preferable to use structured repositories that provide proper metadata."
What happens when Gradle resolves dependencies from a flat directory repository?<br><br>A. Gradle ignores any existing metadata and only uses the files present.<br>B. Gradle generates ad-hoc dependency metadata based on the presence of artifacts.<br>C. Gradle prioritizes flat directory artifacts over those with real metadata.<br>D. Gradle requires all dependencies to be explicitly defined in the build script.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>When resolving dependencies from a flat directory repository, Gradle dynamically generates ad-hoc dependency metadata based on the presence of artifacts. This means that while it can find and use the files present, it prefers modules with real metadata from other declared repositories over those generated by flat directory repositories."
What is the primary purpose of metadata formats in dependency resolution?<br><br>A. To provide a standardized way to describe dependencies and their attributes<br>B. To store the actual binary files of dependencies<br>C. To enhance the performance of build scripts<br>D. To define the programming language used in a project,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The primary purpose of metadata formats in dependency resolution is to provide a standardized way to describe dependencies and their attributes.

Why are flat directory repositories discouraged in dependency management?<br><br>A. They do not support metadata formats like Ivy XML or Maven POM files<br>B. They are too complex to configure<br>C. They require additional authentication steps<br>D. They are only suitable for small projects,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>Flat directory repositories are discouraged in dependency management because they do not support metadata formats like Ivy XML or Maven POM files. This lack of structured metadata makes it difficult for build tools to manage dependencies effectively, leading to potential conflicts and inefficiencies in dependency resolution."
What happens when Gradle finds both a JAR file and a POM file for the same dependency in different repositories?<br><br>A. Gradle will ignore the JAR file and use the POM file<br>B. Gradle will use the metadata from the POM file over the JAR file<br>C. Gradle will use the JAR file and ignore the POM file<br>D. Gradle will throw an error and stop the build process,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>When Gradle finds both a JAR file and a POM file for the same dependency in different repositories, it will use the metadata from the POM file over the JAR file. This is because the POM file contains structured metadata that provides essential information about the dependency, which is crucial for proper resolution and management."
