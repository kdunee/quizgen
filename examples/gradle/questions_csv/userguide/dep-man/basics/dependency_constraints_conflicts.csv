What is a version conflict in dependency resolution?<br><br>A. When two dependencies require the same module but with different versions<br>B. When a dependency is missing from the project<br>C. When a dependency is declared multiple times in the same version<br>D. When a dependency is incompatible with the programming language used,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>A version conflict occurs when two or more dependencies require the same module but specify different versions. This situation can lead to ambiguity in which version should be used, prompting the dependency resolution system to determine the best course of action, typically by selecting the highest version."
How does Gradle typically resolve version conflicts?<br><br>A. By ignoring all version specifications<br>B. By selecting the lowest version available<br>C.

What happens when Gradle encounters a capability conflict?<br><br>A. It automatically resolves the conflict by selecting a version<br>B. It fails the build and reports the conflict<br>C. It ignores the conflict and continues the build<br>D. It prompts the user to manually resolve the conflict,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>When Gradle encounters a capability conflict, it generally fails the build and reports the conflict. This occurs when multiple variants of a component declare the same capability, leading to ambiguity about which variant should be used."
What is a capability conflict in the context of dependency resolution?<br><br>A. When two dependencies require the same module but with different versions<br>B. When multiple artifacts in the dependency graph provide the same functionality<br>C. When a dependency is missing from the project<br>D. When a dependency is declared but not used in the project,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A capability conflict occurs when multiple variants of a component in the dependency graph declare the same capability. This situation can lead to ambiguity about which variant to use, and Gradle typically fails the build and reports the conflict to ensure clarity in dependency resolution."
How does Gradle typically handle capability conflicts during dependency resolution?<br><br>A. It automatically selects the lowest version of the conflicting dependencies<br>B. It ignores the conflict and continues the build process<br>C. It fails the build and reports the conflict<br>D. It merges the conflicting dependencies into a single version,<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>Gradle generally fails the build and reports a capability conflict when it encounters multiple variants of a component that declare the same capability. This approach ensures that developers are aware of the conflict and can take appropriate action to resolve it.
What is one way to resolve capability conflicts in Gradle?<br><br>A. By removing all dependencies from the project<br>B. By specifying which capability to use in the resolutionStrategy block<br>C. By downgrading all dependencies to their lowest versions<br>D. By ignoring the conflict and allowing Gradle to choose automatically,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>One way to resolve capability conflicts in Gradle is by specifying which capability to use in the `resolutionStrategy` block. This allows developers to control which version of a capability is selected, thereby resolving the conflict explicitly."
What is the primary purpose of dependency constraints in Gradle?<br><br>A. To enforce specific versions of dependencies<br>B. To automatically update all dependencies to the latest version<br>C. To remove unused dependencies from the project<br>D. To create a backup of the project dependencies,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The primary purpose of dependency constraints in Gradle is to enforce specific versions of dependencies. This helps ensure that the project uses compatible versions of libraries, preventing potential conflicts and issues during dependency resolution."
What happens when a version conflict occurs in Gradle?<br><br>A. Gradle will ignore the conflict and proceed with the build<br>B. Gradle will select the highest version of the conflicting dependencies<br>C. Gradle will automatically downgrade all dependencies to the lowest version<br>D. Gradle will stop the build and report the conflict,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>When a version conflict occurs in Gradle, it will select the highest version of the conflicting dependencies by default. This approach helps to ensure that the most recent and potentially most compatible version is used in the project."

By ignoring the conflict and allowing Gradle to choose automatically,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Developers can manually resolve capability conflicts in Gradle by specifying which capability to use in the resolutionStrategy block. This allows for greater control over which version of a capability is selected, helping to avoid build failures due to conflicts."
What is the primary purpose of a resolution strategy in dependency management?<br><br>A. To define how to handle conflicts between different versions of dependencies<br>B. To automatically update all dependencies to their latest versions<br>C. To remove unused dependencies from the project<br>D. To create a backup of the project dependencies,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The primary purpose of a resolution strategy in dependency management is to define how to handle conflicts that arise when different versions of dependencies are required.

Module conflict,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A version conflict occurs when two or more dependencies require the same module but specify different versions. This situation necessitates a resolution strategy to determine which version should be used in the project, typically by selecting the highest version by default."
How does Gradle typically resolve version conflicts by default?<br><br>A. By selecting the lowest version available<br>B. By ignoring all version specifications<br>C. By selecting the highest version available<br>D. By prompting the user for a decision,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>By default, Gradle resolves version conflicts by selecting the highest version available among the conflicting dependencies.
