"What is the primary distinction between compile time and runtime dependencies?<br><br>A. Compile time dependencies are only needed for testing, while runtime dependencies are needed for production.<br>B. Compile time dependencies are required for compiling the code, whereas runtime dependencies are needed when the application is running.<br>C. Compile time dependencies are included in the published API, while runtime dependencies are not.<br>D. Compile time dependencies are used for documentation, while runtime dependencies are used for configuration.","<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The primary distinction between compile time and runtime dependencies is that compile time dependencies are required for compiling the code, ensuring that the code can be built successfully, while runtime dependencies are necessary for the application to function correctly during execution. This separation helps manage how dependencies are utilized at different stages of the build process."
