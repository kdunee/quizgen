To manage user permissions for tasks<br>D. To optimize memory usage during execution,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>Task dependencies in Gradle are used to define the order in which tasks are executed. When a task depends on another, Gradle ensures that the dependent task is completed before the task that requires it starts. This helps maintain the correct sequence of operations and ensures that all necessary prerequisites are met."
How can you specify a task dependency in Gradle?<br><br>A. By using the `dependsOn` method in the task configuration<br>B. By listing tasks in the command line without any options<br>C. By using the `@task` annotation in the build script<br>D. By defining tasks in separate files,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>In Gradle, you can specify a task dependency by using the `dependsOn` method within the task configuration. This method allows you to explicitly declare that one task should be executed before another, ensuring that the necessary tasks are completed in the correct order."
"What happens if a task with dependencies is executed in Gradle?<br><br>A. Only the specified task runs, ignoring dependencies<br>B. All dependent tasks are executed first, followed by the specified task<br>C. The execution fails if any dependency is missing<br>D. The task runs in parallel with its dependencies","<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>When a task with dependencies is executed in Gradle, all dependent tasks are executed first, followed by the specified task. This ensures that all prerequisites are completed before the main task runs, maintaining the integrity of the build process."
