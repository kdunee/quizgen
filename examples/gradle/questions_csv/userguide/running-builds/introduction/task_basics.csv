It means the task must wait for another task to complete before it can execute.<br>C. It means the task will execute in parallel with other tasks.<br>D. It means the task can only be executed manually by the user.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>In Gradle, a task dependency means that one task must complete before another task can start. This ensures that tasks are executed in the correct order, particularly when one task relies on the output or completion of another task."
How does Gradle determine the order of task execution?<br><br>A. By the alphabetical order of task names.<br>B. By the order in which tasks are defined in the build script.<br>C. By analyzing the defined task dependencies.<br>D. By the time taken to execute each task previously.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>Gradle determines the order of task execution by analyzing the defined task dependencies. When a task depends on another, Gradle ensures that the dependent task is executed first, maintaining the correct sequence for successful builds."
What is the primary purpose of defining task dependencies in a Gradle build script?<br><br>A. To allow tasks to run simultaneously.<br>B. To ensure that tasks are executed in the correct order.<br>C. To reduce the overall build time.<br>D. To create a visual representation of the build process.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The primary purpose of defining task dependencies in a Gradle build script is to ensure that tasks are executed in the correct order. This is crucial for tasks that rely on the completion of others, as it helps maintain the integrity and success of the build process."
What is the primary purpose of Gradle plugins?<br><br>A. To define the structure of a project<br>B. To add functionality and tasks to a Gradle build<br>C. To manage dependencies between projects<br>D. To compile source code into executable files,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Gradle plugins are designed to add functionality and tasks to a Gradle build. They extend the capabilities of Gradle by providing predefined tasks and configurations that can be used to automate various aspects of the build process, such as compiling code, running tests, and packaging applications."
How can you view all available tasks in a Gradle project?<br><br>A. By running the command `./gradlew list`<br>B. By running the command `./gradlew tasks`<br>C.

What does it mean when a task has dependencies in Gradle?<br><br>A. The task can run independently without any prerequisites<br>B. The task must be executed before other tasks can run<br>C. The task requires other tasks to be completed first<br>D. The task will fail if dependencies are not met,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>When a task has dependencies in Gradle, it means that the task requires other tasks to be completed first before it can run. This ensures that tasks are executed in the correct order, allowing for proper build execution and resource management."
Which command is used to execute a specific task in a Gradle project?<br><br>A. gradle execute <task_name><br>B. gradle run <task_name><br>C. ./gradlew <task_name><br>D. gradle start <task_name>,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>To execute a specific task in a Gradle project, you use the command `./gradlew <task_name>`.

Through defined task dependencies in the build script<br>D. By user input during the build process,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>Gradle determines the order of task execution through defined task dependencies in the build script. When a task depends on another, Gradle ensures that the dependent task is executed first, maintaining the correct sequence for the build process."
What command is used to list all available tasks in a Gradle project?<br><br>A. ./gradlew list<br>B. ./gradlew tasks<br>C. ./gradlew show<br>D. ./gradlew available,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The command used to list all available tasks in a Gradle project is './gradlew tasks'.
