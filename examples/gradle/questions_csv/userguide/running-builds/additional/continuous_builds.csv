To allow tasks to run simultaneously without any restrictions<br>C. To eliminate the need for any manual configuration of tasks<br>D. To automatically generate new tasks based on existing ones,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>The primary purpose of task dependencies in a build system is to ensure that tasks are executed in a specific order based on their relationships. This means that if one task depends on the output of another, the dependent task will only run after the task it relies on has completed successfully, maintaining the integrity of the build process."
"How does Gradle determine the order of task execution?<br><br>A. By the alphabetical order of task names<br>B. Based on the dependencies defined between tasks<br>C. By the time each task was created<br>D. Randomly, to ensure variability in builds","<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Gradle determines the order of task execution based on the dependencies defined between tasks. When a task is executed, Gradle checks its dependencies and ensures that all required tasks are completed before the current task runs, thus maintaining a logical flow in the build process."
"What happens if a task's dependencies are not met in a build system?<br><br>A. The task will execute anyway, ignoring the dependencies<br>B. The build process will fail, and the task will not run<br>C. The task will run but produce incorrect results<br>D. The task will be skipped, and the build will continue","<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>If a task's dependencies are not met in a build system, the build process will fail, and the task will not run. This is to ensure that all necessary conditions are satisfied before executing a task, which helps prevent errors and maintains the integrity of the build."
Which of the following best describes a 'build cycle' in the context of task dependencies?<br><br>A. A situation where tasks are executed in a loop without completion<br>B. A process where tasks are executed in parallel to save time<br>C. A scenario where tasks are skipped due to unmet dependencies<br>D. A method of optimizing task execution by reducing dependencies,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>A 'build cycle' in the context of task dependencies refers to a situation where tasks are executed in a loop without completion. This can occur when a task modifies its own inputs during execution, causing Gradle to detect changes and trigger the task again, leading to an infinite loop of execution unless resolved."

A situation where a task modifies its own inputs during execution, triggering a new build.<br>C. A method to optimize build times by skipping unnecessary tasks.<br>D. A feature that allows multiple builds to run simultaneously.","<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A build cycle occurs when a task modifies its own inputs while executing, leading Gradle to detect the change and trigger a new build. This cycle can continue if the task repeatedly modifies its inputs, preventing it from being considered up-to-date. Understanding build cycles is crucial for diagnosing issues in build processes."
How can you identify a task that is causing a build cycle?<br><br>A. By checking the build script for errors.<br>B. By looking at the list of files reported changed by Gradle.<br>C. By running the build with the `--no-daemon` option.<br>D. By increasing the quiet period in the configuration.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>To identify a task causing a build cycle, you can examine the list of files reported as changed by Gradle. This helps pinpoint which task is modifying its inputs, allowing you to address the issue effectively. This diagnostic approach is essential for maintaining efficient build processes."
What happens if a task modifies its own inputs during a normal build execution?<br><br>A. The task will be considered up-to-date.<br>B. The build will be skipped entirely.<br>C. Gradle will trigger a new build for that task.<br>D. The task will fail due to input conflicts.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>If a task modifies its own inputs during a normal build execution, Gradle will detect this change and trigger a new build for that task. This behavior is similar to what occurs in continuous builds, where input changes lead to immediate rebuilds, highlighting the importance of managing task inputs carefully."
