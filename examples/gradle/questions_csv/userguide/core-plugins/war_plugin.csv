It includes dependencies that are needed at runtime but provided by the deployment environment<br>C. It is used for dependencies that should always be included in the WAR file<br>D. It is the same as 'providedCompile' but for testing purposes,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>'providedRuntime' is specifically for dependencies that are required during the runtime of the application but are provided by the environment in which the WAR is deployed. Unlike 'providedCompile', which is for compile-time dependencies, 'providedRuntime' ensures that only runtime dependencies are managed without being packaged in the WAR."
What is a key characteristic of the 'provided' configurations in the War plugin?<br><br>A. They automatically include all transitive dependencies in the WAR file<br>B. They do not include any dependencies in the WAR file<br>C. They are only applicable to testing dependencies<br>D. They require manual inclusion of all transitive dependencies,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The 'provided' configurations, such as 'providedCompile' and 'providedRuntime', are designed to not include their dependencies in the final WAR file. This is because these dependencies are expected to be available in the deployment environment, thus keeping the WAR file lightweight and avoiding redundancy."
