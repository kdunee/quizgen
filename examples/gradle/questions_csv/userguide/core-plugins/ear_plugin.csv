It places dependencies in the 'lib' directory and includes transitive dependencies.<br>C. It is used for managing build scripts only.<br>D. It is not used in the Ear plugin.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The 'earlib' configuration is designed to place dependencies in the 'lib' directory of the EAR archive and includes transitive dependencies. This means that not only the specified dependencies are included, but also any dependencies that those specified dependencies rely on will be included in the archive."
"What happens if a deployment descriptor file already exists in the specified directory?<br><br>A. The existing file will be deleted.<br>B. The existing file will be ignored, and a new one will be generated.<br>C. The existing file contents will be used, and explicit configuration will be ignored.<br>D. The build will fail due to a conflict.","<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>If a deployment descriptor file already exists in the specified directory (e.g., `META-INF/application.xml`), the existing file contents will be used, and any explicit configuration in the build script regarding the deployment descriptor will be ignored. This allows for custom configurations to take precedence over defaults."

To hold library dependencies<br>D. To keep temporary files during the build process,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The 'META-INF' directory in the project layout for an EAR file is used to contain configuration files and deployment descriptors, such as 'application.xml'. This directory is essential for defining how the application should be deployed and configured."

A default deployment descriptor will be generated automatically<br>C. The application will not be packaged into an EAR file<br>D. The plugin will skip the assembly of the application entirely,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>If a custom deployment descriptor file is not provided when using the Ear plugin, a default deployment descriptor will be generated automatically. This ensures that the application can still be packaged correctly into an EAR file, even if specific configurations are not explicitly defined."
What is the purpose of convention properties in the context of the Ear plugin?<br><br>A. To define default values for various configurations related to the EAR file<br>B. To specify the runtime environment for the application<br>C. To manage the versioning of the application dependencies<br>D. To enforce coding standards within the project,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>Convention properties in the Ear plugin are used to define default values for various configurations related to the EAR file.
