It provides a structured environment that simplifies the process of building scalable and maintainable web applications, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure."
Which of the following statements is true regarding the Play Framework's architecture?<br><br>A. It is based on a monolithic architecture only.<br>B. It supports both MVC and reactive programming paradigms.<br>C. It requires a specific database technology to function.<br>D. It is limited to Java programming language only.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The Play Framework supports both the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and reactive programming paradigms. This flexibility allows developers to choose the best approach for their application needs, promoting a more efficient and responsive design."
What significant change occurred in Gradle 6 regarding Play Framework support?<br><br>A. Play web application support was enhanced.<br>B. Play web application support was deprecated.<br>C. Play Framework became the only supported framework.<br>D. Play Framework was integrated into Gradle's core functionality.,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>In Gradle 6, Play web application support was deprecated and replaced by an external Play plugin. This change indicates a shift in how Play applications are managed within the Gradle ecosystem, encouraging users to adopt the new Gradle Play Plugin for their development needs."
"What is the primary purpose of software licensing?<br><br>A. To restrict the use of software to a specific group of users<br>B. To provide users with the right to use, modify, and distribute software<br>C. To ensure that software is free of bugs and errors<br>D. To increase the price of software products","<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The primary purpose of software licensing is to provide users with the legal rights to use, modify, and distribute software. Licenses define how software can be used and what restrictions apply, ensuring that both the creators and users understand their rights and responsibilities."
Which of the following is a common type of software license?<br><br>A. Proprietary License<br>B. Hardware License<br>C. Network License<br>D. User License,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>A Proprietary License is a common type of software license that restricts the use, modification, and distribution of the software. Unlike open-source licenses, proprietary licenses typically do not allow users to access the source code or make modifications."
What does an open-source software license typically allow users to do?<br><br>A. Use the software only for personal projects<br>B. Modify and distribute the software freely<br>C. Sell the software for profit<br>D. Access the software without any restrictions,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>An open-source software license typically allows users to modify and distribute the software freely. This type of license promotes collaboration and sharing within the software community, enabling users to improve and adapt the software to their needs."
What is the primary purpose of a plugin architecture in software development?<br><br>A. To create a monolithic application structure<br>B. To allow for modular and extensible application design<br>C. To eliminate the need for any external libraries<br>D. To ensure all components are tightly coupled,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The primary purpose of a plugin architecture is to allow for modular and extensible application design. This approach enables developers to add or modify functionalities without altering the core application, promoting flexibility and maintainability."
Which of the following best describes a plugin in the context of software architecture?<br><br>A. A standalone application that operates independently<br>B. A component that adds specific features to an existing application<br>C. A framework that dictates the entire application structure<br>D. A tool used for debugging and testing applications,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A plugin is best described as a component that adds specific features to an existing application. It enhances the application's capabilities without requiring changes to the core codebase, allowing for greater customization and functionality."
What is a key benefit of using a plugin architecture in application development?<br><br>A. It simplifies the deployment process by reducing the number of components<br>B. It allows for easier updates and maintenance of individual components<br>C. It requires all components to be developed in the same programming language<br>D. It eliminates the need for version control systems,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>A key benefit of using a plugin architecture is that it allows for easier updates and maintenance of individual components. Since plugins are modular, developers can update or replace them independently without affecting the entire application, leading to improved efficiency in development and maintenance."
