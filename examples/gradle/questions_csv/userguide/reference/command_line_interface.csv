"How does Gradle handle task dependencies when executing multiple tasks?<br><br>A. It executes all tasks simultaneously without considering dependencies<br>B. It executes tasks in the order they are listed on the command line, ignoring dependencies<br>C. It respects the dependencies and executes tasks in the correct order<br>D. It randomly selects tasks to execute without any order","<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br>Gradle respects task dependencies when executing multiple tasks. It ensures that tasks are executed in the correct order based on their dependencies, meaning that if a task depends on another, the dependent task will be executed first. This guarantees that all prerequisites are satisfied before a task runs, maintaining the integrity of the build process."
What happens if a task with dependencies is executed without its prerequisites being completed?<br><br>A. The task will execute successfully regardless of dependencies<br>B. The task will fail to execute<br>C. The task will skip execution and move to the next one<br>D. The task will execute but produce incorrect results,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>If a task with dependencies is executed without its prerequisites being completed, the task will fail to execute. Gradle enforces the execution order based on task dependencies, and if a required task has not been completed, the dependent task cannot run. This mechanism helps prevent errors and ensures that all necessary conditions are met before a task is executed."
"Which command-line option can be used to exclude a task from execution, even if it has dependencies?<br><br>A. --skip-task<br>B. --exclude-task<br>C. --ignore-dependencies<br>D. --no-execute","<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The command-line option `--exclude-task` can be used to exclude a task from execution, even if it has dependencies.
