This command triggers the process that packages the library and its dependencies into a ZIP archive.
Where should static files be placed to include them in the distribution ZIP?<br><br>A. In the src/main/java directory<br>B. In the src/dist directory<br>C. In the build directory<br>D. In the src/main/resources directory,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>To include static files in the distribution ZIP, they should be placed in the 'src/dist' directory. This directory is specifically designated for files that need to be included in the final distribution package."
What does the 'distZip' task depend on in the Java library distribution plugin?<br><br>A. compileJava<br>B. jar<br>C. test<br>D. assemble,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>The 'distZip' task in the Java library distribution plugin depends on the 'jar' task. This means that the JAR file must be created before the distribution ZIP can be generated, ensuring that the library is packaged correctly."
What are runtime dependencies in the context of a Java library distribution?<br><br>A. Files required for compiling the library<br>B. Libraries needed for the library to function at runtime<br>C. Documentation files for the library<br>D. Configuration files for the build process,"<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Runtime dependencies are libraries or components that a Java library requires to function correctly when it is executed.
