They are not available when configuring subprojects from the root project build script.<br>C. They require additional plugins to function.<br>D. They can only be used with Groovy DSL scripts.,<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br>Type-safe accessors are not available when configuring subprojects from the root project build script. This limitation arises because the configuration of subprojects in this context does not allow for the type-safe accessors that are typically available when using the `plugins {}` block.
"In a multi-project build, what should be done if a plugin cannot be declared using the `plugins {}` block?<br><br>A. Use the `buildscript {}` block to declare the plugin.<br>B. Declare the plugin only in the subprojects.<br>C. Use the `apply {}` method exclusively.<br>D. Ignore the plugin and use alternatives.","<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br>If a plugin cannot be declared using the `plugins {}` block, you should use the `buildscript {}` block to declare the plugin. This approach is necessary for plugins that are not published with the required metadata for the `plugins {}` block, allowing you to still include them in your build."
