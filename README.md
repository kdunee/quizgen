# QuizGen: AI-Powered Question Generation Tool

*Effortlessly create AI-generated quizzes from your educational content.*

QuizGen is a Python-based tool that generates quiz questions from educational materials using state-of-the-art AI models. It's designed for educators, course creators, and developers looking to automate question creation from textbooks, lecture notes, and other learning resources, saving time and enhancing the learning experience. With QuizGen, you can streamline quiz creation for online courses, exam preparation, and interactive learning tools like Anki.

The tool processes content, extracts key concepts, generates relevant questions, and outputs them in formats suitable for e-learning platforms, such as Anki.

## Key Features

- **Automatic concept extraction**: Identifies key concepts from provided educational content.
- **AI-powered question generation**: Uses advanced AI models to create high-quality, diverse quiz questions.
- **Question similarity reduction**: Reduces redundancy in generated questions by comparing embeddings.
- **Anki integration**: Easily import generated questions into Anki for flashcard-based learning.
- **Extensible and customizable**: Modify templates and fine-tune the output to suit specific educational needs.

## Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Python 3.10 or later installed.
- An OpenAI API key (available from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup)).
- Anki with AnkiConnect installed if you plan to use the Anki import feature.

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kdunee/quizgen.git
   cd quizgen
   ```

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

1. Set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Troubleshooting

- **Python version issues**: Ensure your Python version is 3.10+ by running `python --version`.
- **Outdated `pip`**: Upgrade `pip` if needed by running `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`.
- For additional help, check the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs).

## Workflow

Here's the typical workflow for using QuizGen:

1. **Generate Questions:** Use the `generate` command to create questions from your source material. This outputs JSON files.
2. **Convert to CSV (Optional):** If needed, use the `convert` command to convert the JSON files to CSV.
3. **Generate Embeddings:** Use the `embeddings` command to create embeddings from the JSON questions. This is necessary for the next step.
4. **Thin Out Questions (Optional):** Â Use the `thin` command with the CSV and embeddings to reduce similar questions.
5. **Import to Anki (Optional):** Use the `anki` command with the CSV files to import your questions into Anki.

## Usage

QuizGen provides a unified command-line interface (CLI) to access all its functionalities. Here's how you can use it:

```bash
python quizgen.py <command> [options]
```

**Available Commands:**

- **generate:** Generate questions from educational content.

   ```bash
    # Generate questions from a single chapter:
    python quizgen.py generate --chapter-path path/to/chapter.md --title "Course Title" --output path/to/output.json

    # Generate questions in batch mode:
    python quizgen.py generate --batch --input-dir path/to/source/files --output-dir path/to/output/json --title "Course Title"
    ```

- **convert:** Convert questions from JSON to CSV format.

    ```bash
    # Convert questions to CSV:
    python quizgen.py convert --batch --input-dir path/to/json/files --output-dir path/to/csv/output
    ```

- **embeddings:** Generate embeddings for question comparison.

    ```bash
    # Generate embeddings:
    python quizgen.py embeddings --batch --input-dir path/to/json/files --output-dir path/to/embeddings/output
    ```

- **thin:** Reduce similar questions using embeddings.

    ```bash
    # Thin out questions:
    python quizgen.py thin --csv-dir path/to/csv/files --embeddings-dir path/to/embeddings --output-dir path/to/output --T 10 
    ```

- **anki:** Import questions into Anki.

    ```bash
    # Import to Anki:
    python quizgen.py anki --input-dir path/to/csv/files --root-deck-name "Root Deck Name" 
    ```
