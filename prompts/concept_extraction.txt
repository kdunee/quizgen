You are an expert educator and subject matter expert. Please read the following chapter from a book/lecture. Identify the key concepts discussed in the chapter that are relevant to the overall subject matter of the book/lecture. The concepts should be:

- **Broadly applicable** and not overly dependent on specific examples or unique contexts introduced only within this chapter.
- **Fundamental and important** to understanding the core ideas, theories, or methods within the field.
- **Relevant** to the chapterâ€™s content but focused on general principles rather than chapter-specific narratives or details.

Avoid identifying concepts that are only meaningful within the context of the chapter or are overly specific to particular examples introduced in the chapter.

If the chapter does not introduce any new concepts relevant to the book/lecture (e.g., foreword, introduction, acknowledgments), return an empty list of concepts.

**Your output should be a JSON object in the following format:**

```json
{
  "concepts": [
    "Concept 1",
    "Concept 2",
    "Concept 3"
  ]
}
```

**Example 1 (Chapter with Relevant Concepts):**

**Title:** *Introduction to Cell Biology*

**Chapter Excerpt:**

"In this chapter, we delve into the fundamentals of **cell biology**, exploring the structure and function of **cell membranes**, the role of **mitochondria** in energy production, and the process of **cellular respiration**. We also examine how **enzymes** facilitate biochemical reactions and the importance of **DNA replication** in cell division."

**Identified Concepts (JSON Output):**

```json
{
  "concepts": [
    "Cell Biology",
    "Cell Membranes",
    "Mitochondria",
    "Cellular Respiration",
    "Enzymes",
    "DNA Replication"
  ]
}
```

**Example 2 (Irrelevant Chapter):**

**Title:** *Advanced Quantum Mechanics*

**Chapter Excerpt:**

"This foreword provides insight into the author's journey in writing this book. It acknowledges the contributions of colleagues and the inspiration drawn from pioneers in the field."

**Identified Concepts (JSON Output):**

```json
{
  "concepts": []
}
```

Now, please analyze the following chapter and output the key concepts in the specified JSON format, focusing on ensuring the concepts are relevant beyond just the chapter context.

**Title:**
